I think you’re trying to distinguish between what you have to do to live and what you would choose to do if you didn’t have to worry about making a living. That’s certainly a worthwhile point to make, but again, I don’t think that in and of itself is slavery. (I wasn’t at all implying that what you would choose to do was separate yourself from society, given the opportunity—if that’s how you read the example.)<p>My example may miss the mark, but it wasn’t intended to.

We&#x27;re going to see a Linux operating system that&#x27;s actually pleasant to use. Not just a window manager, not just a desktop environment, but an operating system.

The amount of vulnerable routers in America is going to hit a breaking point. (With a bit of luck, this will be used for good, not evil. Possibly distributed Tor relays?)<p>21. Political tracking is going to become far more prominent, and far creepier. With how much data you can get by going into virtually any government office in America with $50, it seems inevitable.

Interpreted languages will experience a renaissance.<p>44. 1366x768 is still going to be in the top-10 resolutions globally barring the event that VR displays become prominent.<p>45.

Traditional companies will become tech companies to an even greater extent as they notice their revenue peaking, and if there&#x27;s any chance of a research operating system becoming a global phenomenon again, it will be because of this.

A fun weekend project is to write an octal &quot;decompiler&quot; (ideally you won&#x27;t have compiled anything, just having written some octal by hand) that allows you to reason with what it&#x27;s doing by translating it to an actual language rather than just thin syntactic sugar over 1s and 0s. Octal itself isn&#x27;t so difficult, it makes binary much easier to reason with, but this definitely helps you get a more intuitive sense of what is what.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s not something that has a substantial amount of value with modern machines.

Seems like some members of the opensource community will never learn the lessons from the past.</i><p>The lessons <i>of</i> the past are that all attempts to draw users away from their distribution&#x27;s packages end in misery. AppImage is the only half-decent &quot;solution&quot; here, and not even it&#x27;s very good.<p><i>And I&#x27;m not talking exactly about all the duplicated effort that packagers use(d) to perform in order to distribute software for each distribution. I&#x27;m especially referring to the gatekeeper mentality of curating&#x2F;releasing software.</i><p>There is no duplicate effort from repackaging software for another distribution. You can literally automate most of it 90% of the time, and when you can&#x27;t it only takes a minute to write.<p><i>a) Thanks to the sandboxing technologies used in the Linux packaging solution of this century (e.g. flatpak, snap), one doesn&#x27;t need to worry so much about how evil a developer is.</i><p>Not even Apple gets sandboxing perfect, and Red Hat and Canonical demonstrate incompetence all the time.<p><i>b) If a software project is truly opensource, there&#x27;s no reason why the packaging efforts on top of it cannot be opensourced either. What does this mean? That its packaging approach can be forked in the same way as one would do with the sources of the project itself.</i><p>This already happens with the current methods; what you&#x27;re proposing is a terrible solution to a problem that doesn&#x27;t exist.<p><i>One could even fork the packaging of a project, not just because it contradicts their principles (e.g. an app that requires too many OS permissions for what it&#x27;s meant to achieve), but also because it doesn&#x27;t provide good stability (e.g. an app which keeps sending updates marked as bugfixes when in reality it&#x27;s bringing new features that introduce regressions).</i><p>This demonstrates that you probably aren&#x27;t aware of how packaging actually works on Linux. Distributions like Debian and RHEL backport security and bugfixes while preventing feature releases.<p><i>There shouldn&#x27;t be any difference between downstream and upstream. If you think a developer is not packaging well their software, why not send him a PullRequest instead of to other group of developers (packagers) that didn&#x27;t write the software originally?</i><p>&quot;Pull Request&quot; is a GitHub-specific term, and GitHub is awful for packaging. Further, this completely misses the point of packagers. I&#x27;m just wondering, does your primary computer run Linux or Windows?<p>Also, your claim &quot;There shouldn&#x27;t be any difference between downstream and upstream.&quot; directly conflicts with your claim on feature updates.<p><i>Developers might suck at packaging, granted. But they also suck at UX&#x2F;UI design, but end up doing the best thing they can. Ultimately a designer might join them to improve the project, why not letting also the helping hand of packagers contribute to upstream directly, instead of setting up their own cult?</i><p>Packaging software is not a cult by literally any <i>possible</i> definition of &quot;cult,&quot; literally or figuratively. No packager is going to waste their time contributing to something that actively makes the Linux ecosystem worse. With flatpak and snap, the size per program skyrockets, and the amount of hassle on the user skyrockets, similarly.",

The post mentioned of Google, Facebook and Amazon empire, all partly grows to this point because of Smartphones. Technology companies together now worth close to 10 Trillions. The whole manufacturing supply chain exists and became huge in Shenzhen because of Smartphone. It was the reason why TSMC managed to catch up to Intel in both capacity and leading edge node. It was the reason why we went from 3G to 5G in mere 10 years because of all the investment kept pouring it. It was the reason why everyone went on to the Internet and had Internet economy. It brought a handheld PC and Internet to a much wider audience.
I would even argue it was the Smartphone innovation that saved us from the post 2008 Financial Crisis doom as it created so much wealth, innovation and opportunities.",

But, as someone who knows both Japanese and a variety of programming languages, I&#x27;ve always seen the &quot;seams&quot; of Japanese a bit differently. I&#x27;ve always thought of Japanese as a stack-based language, like Forth.<p>A refresher on Forth: in Forth, you run a lexer over text input to get a stream of tokens; but you don&#x27;t run a parser (or at least not much of one) over the tokens to get an AST. Instead, each lexeme—each &quot;word&quot; in Forth—self-describes as either a literal or a symbol representing a function call. All words the lexer encounters are immediately &quot;run&quot; using the runtime. Structured programming (like defining functions and then later calling them) is enabled by having the runtime itself be a finite-state machine, that can be put in different states by the execution of certain words, such that all words that are executed in the new state are executed to different effect (e.g. the word `[` will make all words up to a matching `]` have the execution semantics of pushing their symbolic representation onto the stack, sort of like a Lisp quote; the `]` itself then captures what&#x27;s on the stack and builds a function, sort of like the `defmodule` macro does in Elixir.)<p>Analogously, in Japanese, most words are literals, that just push themselves onto the stack; while there are two types of &quot;active&quot; words: grammatical particles and verbs. Each particle is a construction function, which attempts to match and consume a certain shape of existing words on the stack, pushing back a tagged structure in its place; and then verbs consume a particular set of tagged structures from the stack (varying by verb), in any order, leaving on the stack anything they didn&#x27;t expect, and pushing back a representation of the structured meaning of the sentence-as-a-whole up to that point.<p>I think this is well-represented by showing how Japanese does quotation:<p>上司は「私は彼が好きじゃない！」と言った。<p>To transliterate and rewrite this in a Forth-like grammar, with grammatical particles as lower-case keyword symbols, verbs as upper-case bare symbols, and everything else as quoted literal words:<p>&quot;Boss&quot; :subject [ &quot;I&quot; :subject &quot;him&quot; :referent DISLIKE NEGATION ] :cons SAID.<p>Note that, in this particular case, the brackets are sugar here: the sentence would have the same semantics without them. (They&#x27;re helpful to visually disambiguate where you should mentally backtrack to, but it&#x27;s clear by the fact that there&#x27;s two :subject-particles that the inner verb DISLIKE is only going to capture the last-pushed one, leaving the previously-pushed one on the stack for SAID to later consume.)<p>One could also describe this as what a shift-reduce parser does internally, but with the reduction edges triggered as explicit command-words in the input lexeme stream, rather than being triggered implicitly by non-conflicting pattern-matches.<p>And this is <i>also</i>, as it happens, the core of any pure-functional abstract-machine bytecode ISA (e.g. Erlang&#x27;s BEAM bytecode ISA.) You&#x27;ve got ops that push literals; ops that take patterns of stuff off the stack and push back new product-types containing those same things; and ops for calls to (maybe-built-in) functions named by a pushed symbol term.",

Same with MacOS applications since 1984, except at first it was Pascal and 68000 assembly.  CICS was originally single-threaded, running transactions written in System&#x2F;370 assembler and later COBOL, until they bolted multithreading onto it in order to take advantage of the new SMP mainframes IBM was building.  thttpd is from 1998 and is of course written in C; see <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.acme.com&#x2F;software&#x2F;thttpd&#x2F;benchmarks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.acme.com&#x2F;software&#x2F;thttpd&#x2F;benchmarks.html</a>.  One of the biggest changes in web-server software over the last ten years has been the move away from Apache to nginx, which is of course event-driven and written in C.<p>&gt; <i>async code is harder to reason about versus synchronous code.</i><p>Well, this is surely true.  But generally the choice isn&#x27;t async code or sync code; it&#x27;s async code or <i>multithreading</i>.  And async code is <i>much</i> easier to reason about than threads-and-locks code.<p>When you can hack it, a better approach is <i>multiprocessing</i>, also known as <i>message passing</i>, where each thread has its own private memory space, so it looks just like sync code.  That&#x27;s how Unix was built (though not just one but several broken threads models got bolted onto it later), it&#x27;s how Erlang works, and it&#x27;s the model adopted for JS in Web Workers.  It has some performance cost.  (Transactions, as in CICS or the Haskell STM, are another appealing option.)<p>Rust offers a really interesting alternative here: it statically proves that it&#x27;s impossible for multiple threads to share access to writable memory (except when you cross you fingers and say &quot;unsafe&quot;), so in effect the threads are compiler-enforced multiple processes, but with the ability to dynamically freeze data so you can start sharing it between those processes.<p>From my point of view, what happened is that preemptive shared-memory multithreading with locks became a lot more popular in the 1990s and 2000s, driven by a rise in popularity of two systems originally developed for microcomputers without memory protection: Win16 (later Win32, Win64) and Java.  Real-time control systems like the THERAC-25 control system have always used preemptive shared-memory multithreading, invariably with locks.  (In the minimal case they use interrupt handlers rather than full-fledged multiple threads, but those have the same issue.)  With the advantage of historical perspective, we can now see that it was a mistake to extend that programming paradigm to  things like GUIs and web servers, but to some extent we&#x27;re stuck with it for legacy systems like the JVM, Win64, and pthreads.<p>For new systems, though, we can use async, or multiprocessing, or transactions, or Rust&#x27;s borrow checker, or a mixture.",

It&#x27;s worth writing a Python binding for your C or C++ project so you can test it with Hypothesis.

That is, precisely: enough that each new person who masters Rust will be able to find work writing Rust. (To be clear, it would be good if this were to happen.)<p>The deepest observation in the article is the remark about the cognitive load imposed by need to avoid pitfalls inherent in the programming model.<p>I coded K&amp;R C in the 80s, and while I never shipped an argument-type bug, avoiding them was a continual distraction. I coded C90 from 2006 to 2012, with a similar cognitive load I was happy to leave behind, although again I never shipped a bug caused by its failings. (We had bugs, but they were specification bugs: building the wrong thing.)<p>Writing C++ post-14 has been an increasing pleasure. The cognitive load noted is present at times, but decreasingly so as the Standard Library and other libraries get more powerful.<p>I am disappointed that the author found it too hard to implement a correct program with C++, but more disappointed that he chose to blame his tools for his failure.<p>It has become fashionable to insist that correct programs cannot be written in this or that unfashionable language, but in fact a great many correct programs have been written in all of them, not excepting octal machine code.<p>What varies is how much work is needed, and how many people can do it: it is certain that, for any chosen language past or future, most people cannot or will not write a correct program in it. Rust is not different in this.<p>Many people coding C++, and perhaps most coding C, are not writing correct code, and have over the years written a very great deal of bad code. Will those same people succeed in learning Rust, and learning to write good code in it? It appears that the people currently adopting Rust are more skilled than is typical, so it seems hard to generalize their results to more typical programmers.<p>C++ and Rust embody different choices in emphasis: Rust, safety; C++, library power. Stewards of C++ have decided the best way to get substantial correct programs is to enable encapsulating semantics in well-tested, well-optimized libraries that can be used without compromising performance or system architecture. Rust has chosen to emphasize making wrong low-level code hard to express, although its ability to express libraries will only increase.<p>It will not be clear for a long time which will have better results. Will enough people learn Rust to write the correct low-level code needed? Will enough C++ programmers learn to use libraries that make (re-)writing dangerous low-level code unnecessary?<p>What is clear is that the number of C++ programmers is growing faster than ever, and interest in coding to high level C++ libraries, as measured by attendance at an ever increasing number of conferences, is exploding. Even attendance at each ISO Standard meeting is quite a lot larger than at each previous one, now reliably in hundreds. The number of new C++ programmers in any unit time is still larger than the number of new Rust programmers, by a large factor.<p>So, the experiment is interesting and valuable. What we can be confident about, either way, is that, for every C coder, or C++ coder writing low-level, often bad code, switching to Rust or to C++ using reliable libraries will result in more good code. It matters much less which they choose.",

Healthier employees cost less to insure, and health insurance is a large cost of employing people.&quot;<p>Health information is private for very good reasons. Employers who don&#x27;t understand medicine have no business gaining access to our medical records, making decisions, and potentially discriminating based on their ignorant assumptions about employee health statues and problems.<p>&quot;If the American people don&#x27;t like this, then they need to vote for health insurance to be totally separate from employment. But Americans won&#x27;t do that, because that&#x27;s &quot;socialism&quot;. So we&#x27;re getting exactly what we&#x27;ve voted for.&quot;<p>This &quot;we&quot; business is a very lazy argument. There are large numbers of people who have been against this system. &quot;WE&quot; are not getting what &quot;we&quot; voted for, without even considering that we haven&#x27;t really had the opportunity to vote for it in the first place.<p>&quot;If employers are expected to subsidize your health insurance costs, they have every right to your health information.&quot;<p>This subsidization is a pooled, monetary component of employee compensation. While population-based behaviors will impact the overall insurance cost, individaul behaviors aren&#x27;t likely to. But since you&#x27;re so bent on giving employers actionable information about worker lifestyle choices, perhaps you should focus on easy choices that impact ability to work like prescription drug use like Ambien, guys who stay up late to watch sports, or anyone who stays up late to watch late shows, drinking too much, eating too much, eating an unhealthy diet (which depends on who you ask of course) . . .<p>By the way: given that employer-mediated health insurance is part of the compensation package, if this mediation was no longer connected with employment, do you just assume that the employer keeps the money that was previously part of an employee&#x27;s earnings? Or do employees get the compensation that was bargained for? Or is it sent to the government for the provision of universal healthcare?

Western colonialism didn&#x27;t reduce China and India to insignificant economies; their insignificance is what enabled Western powers to colonize them so easily.<p>This is one of the most outlandishly false things I&#x27;ve read. China and india&#x27;s economic significance is the reason why western powers wanted to colonize china and india in the first place. Their economic importance is why europe first sought out india and china. It&#x27;s why columbus &quot;sailed the ocean blue&quot;.<p>&gt; The reduction to insignificance already happened earlier, when the West began to industrialize.<p>The colonization of india and china started before western industrialization. And it was colonizers who prevented india and china from industrializing like Japan. Funny how colonization ended and china ( and india though more slowly ) started industrializing huh?<p>&gt; For example, the establishment of free-trade zones for foreign merchants is judged to be humiliating because it was the consequence of military defeat. But when the CCP later established special economic zones to boost international trade, that was seen as very much a good thing.<p>Because the former was for the benefit of foreign merchants to loot a nation and the latter was for the benefit of china. Surely, even you can see the difference of a territory conquered by a foreign power to loot a nation vs a territory a nation sets up itself for trade?",

In our case several dozen machines all have to come to the same decision at the same time (because round robin) and I was having none of it. I eventually had to tell him, in the nicest way possible, to fuck off, I&#x27;m doing this through Consul.<p>The thing is that people who generally don&#x27;t learn from their mistakes absolutely do not learn from their <i>old</i> mistakes.

You know, I would’ve sworn I had a pat answer to this question, but it turned out I had to think about a little bit.<p>They say that some of the most rewarding interactions for teachers are the ones where they learn something, not jus the student. Every once in a while I get an example of that in real life.<p>So what are some examples?  Programming language is often difficult to change. This is sometimes listed as a pro for microservices. Because I get to change my mind for every new area of the app, which makes it cheaper to reverse directions.<p>The most obvious answers that I have are load balancers and external caches. I shouldn’t have a big knockdown drag out argument over haproxy vs nginx. Now, a load balancer is almost a given. It’s possible that someday in the future, someone will invent an SMP machine with 256 cores that gets some economy of scale by running a whole website on two machines.  It’s easier to reduce the number of machines behind a load balancer than it is to add a load balancer to a mature product.  So put one in, but don’t fight about which one. We don’t know if we need haproxy features, or if we want paid support from nginx now.  Just flip a coin and move on.<p>Similarly, external caches are usually easier to turn off than internal ones. With internal caches, people start to pass around IDs instead of objects, assuming object lookup is “free”. It becomes integral to the information architecture. A rat’s nest of lazy and duplicate lookups.  External caches are cheap but never free. Access tends to leave bigger footprints in the code.  And there’s some small hope that you can get a direct lookup down to a small multiple of the cache lookup time if it really becomes necessary.<p>Database architecture is another big one, for certain dimensions. Going with Oracle is hard to take back.  MySQL vs Postgres is smaller. KV store versus MVCC SQL database is also harder.  For a prototype it might make sense to pick one that is obviously a placeholder, like SQLite, until you know what your customer’s needs really are. Do they need audit trails? Are they addicted to graphs?  Multitenant security? On and on. You can stave off fights with SQLite because it’s effectively a promise to revisit this later.",

Lots of good resources and explanations there.<p>&gt;&gt; VPNs pay for address delegation, I would guess.<p>&gt; Depends on how you look at it. I havent been in the NSP industry for a decade but usually customers would get a &#x2F;24 or &#x2F;22 of the NSPs allocation for free as part of the actual network service cost. Once you&#x27;re bigger than that the customer (eg VPN provider) should be getting allocations&#x2F;assignments directly. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arin.net&#x2F;resources&#x2F;registry&#x2F;reassignments&#x2F;#allocations-vs-assignments"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arin.net&#x2F;resources&#x2F;registry&#x2F;reassignments&#x2F;#alloc...</a><p>OK, but I was thinking of HideMyAss, for example. Its cluster near Nuland, NL has 109 IPv4 addresses. RIPE tells me that they&#x27;re all over the world. But latency tells me that they&#x27;re all near Nuland.<p>So where did HideMyAss get all those IPv4 addresses? I&#x27;m guessing that some firm has obtained delegated IPv4 blocks from NSPs in all those places, and then allocated addresses to HideMyAss. And it has apparently become a huge business sector, especially with IPv4 exhaustion. But also for providing VPN services, spammers, etc with deceptive PoPs.<p>I looked into that using <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bgp.he.net&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bgp.he.net&#x2F;</a> but all that&#x27;s on another VM that I lack the RAM to run right now. It might even be HideMyAss&#x27; NSP for that facility.<p>&gt; The tunnel itself wouldnt necessarily add meaningful latency or interfere with your methodology. But it would obscure the topology that you&#x27;d see at the IP&#x2F;ICMP (trceroute or BGP) level. So maybe the router is in AMS-IX, but that router could tunnel the packets to another device in Germany. Traceroute or DNS might not show that, but you&#x27;d see a latency anomaly there. Related to my geo-political comment if a user cares about law enforcement the physical location of the end device could very much matter.<p>Right. Latency for a direct tunnel might well be lower than that for Internet transport. And as you say, the tunnel can&#x27;t hide from latency testing. It&#x27;s just that traceroute just sees a discontinuity.",

I don&#x27;t mean that flippantly. Do many people find reading books useful or enriching or valuable? Oh, yes, certainly. Now: worth <i>what</i>? To you? Are films worth &quot;it&quot;? Are Casablanca, The Seventh Seal, the Up documentary series, Manos: The Hands of Fate, Cave of Forgotten Dreams, Mars Attacks!, and Debbie does Dallas, worth &quot;it&quot;? Are they all replaceable with a bunch of 5- to 15-minute Youtube videos?<p>&gt; Is it more true for some fields than others?<p>Self-improvement, pop-business&#x2F;leadership books, and generally anything written to sell consulting services (there&#x27;s a lot of that in both those categories) are regarded as kinda jokes. If you&#x27;re looking there for wisdom you&#x27;re combing the desert for a pearl.<p>&gt; Is it more true for older books?<p>The filter is that if a book is still considered good decades, centuries, or millennia after it was written, it very probably is good. Good books somtimes don&#x27;t pass this filter (these are periodically rediscovered) for various reasons. But almost no bad or low-value books pass it.<p>&gt; Isn&#x27;t most of the information from books freely available online?<p>Not at all. Start studying any topic past the surface level and the only way you&#x27;ll get any further &quot;online&quot; is buying or pirating ebooks. Keep digging—not even that far—and you&#x27;ll find some that do not exist in digital form, not even on Library Genesis. If you want to seriously learn about a topic, pick up a good academic book on it, then follow up on all the books they (very probably) mention in their introduction as other major works on the topic, and maybe also the books that book directly credits as references. Often this is a faster and more accurate way to learn what the expert consensus of &quot;foundational&quot; works in a topic is than trying to find that out online, let alone trying to learn the information contained in those works purely online, without books (usually impossible).<p>&gt; Am I missing out?<p>What is &quot;it&quot;?<p>&gt; One issue for me is that books are a very big time investment. I read very slowly and I don&#x27;t remember everything I read either.<p>Take notes.<p>&gt; Even if I wanted to read books, I just don&#x27;t know which ones I should start with, out of the 1000 &quot;must-read&quot; books in my reading list.<p>Stop. Pick, like, five that seem really important or that you just most want to read. Aim for variety, don&#x27;t pick five all on the same topic. Ignore the rest until you&#x27;re done. Don&#x27;t even think about them. If you&#x27;re not going to finish five there&#x27;s no damn point in maintaining and stressing out over a list of 1,000. They&#x27;ll still be there when you&#x27;ve finished your five.<p>One further note: as hinted at by the movie comparison above, reading a book is a <i>process</i> and that process is part of the effect of the book. The time it takes, the curation or generation of material by one author or editor or a team of same working together, the focus and intention of the creators, these matter. Reading 200 blog posts is not the same experience as reading a book, even if they mostly cover the same territory. A tree can become boards, but boards cannot become a tree.",

Things like, no feedback that a button&#x27;s been pressed? Guess what a kid (or hell, adult) is gonna do? Hammer the button! Which... then keeps it greyed out once it does register the press, but doesn&#x27;t ever progress, so you&#x27;re stuck on the screen and have to go back and start the lesson over.

Theft causes harm to society because it deprives property from somebody that legally owns it. Humans can&#x27;t survive without property in nature, which means that theft harms their survival. Furthermore, rampant theft in society means that individuals will spend a lot of effort on securing their property, effort that could&#x27;ve been used for better effect. Hate speech, on the other hand, is about being offended. Offense is taken, not given. Remember that speech that intimidates or harasses is <i>already</i> illegal and not part of hate speech laws.<p>&gt;<i>that is why there are courts and judges and juries to settle cases and set precedents.</i><p>This is still punishing. I imagine that most of us on this site agree that copyright law is not in a good spot right now, because justice is often only had when you spend a lot of money defending yourself.

These few solid basics will last you for decades without having to &quot;keep up with the Joneses&quot; learning every day&#x27;s new Javascript framework.<p>The main marketable thing is your portfolio&#x2F;resume and client testimonials, if any.

Outside of alarms and notifications in the background (which tend to be routed through a common service), the user can see just one app at a time, and mobile OSes actively restrict background activity of other apps. So every application can get away with the assumption that it&#x27;s the sole owner of the phone&#x27;s resources.<p>Two, given the above, the most noticeable problem is now power usage. As Moore&#x27;s law has all but evaporated for single-threaded performance, hardware is now being upgraded for multicore and (important here) power performance. So apps can get away with poor engineering, because every new generation of smartphones has a more power-efficient CPU, so the lifetime on single charge doesn&#x27;t degrade.",

If you look at modern software, it all looks so great at the point of sale.

My favourite is Observable (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;observablehq.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;observablehq.com&#x2F;</a>), where code has reactive structure (resolving a DAG like a literate program would at tangle-time), you can choose to keep some code hidden by default (to reduce clutter, make the document end-to-end readable), and use code to make the notebook fully interactive.<p>In terms of Knuth-style literate programming, Org Mode in Emacs, with its Org Babel feature, is a very good tool for this. It&#x27;s an outliner with rich markup, and where you&#x27;d ordinarily insert a code block, in Org Mode, you can also execute it (works with any language you&#x27;ve configured Emacs to connect to) and feed the results to further code blocks. So it works like a computational notebook. You can also tangle the blocks to produce a separate source file, the Knuth way. One common application I&#x27;ve seen is making literate Emacs configuration - people prepare the minimum necessary to set up Org Babel, and then tangle the proper (often large) config from an .org file, where it&#x27;s written in literate style.<p>As for my own experience, I occasionally try literate programming on small things, and so far - outside using org mode as a Jupyter alternative - I didn&#x27;t feel more productive with it. I often flesh out the idea of a solution while writing it (I alternate between coding&#x2F;recoding and design phases), and literate programming adds extra work - refactoring code means also refactoring the surrounding prose. On top of that, the narrative structure seems to interfere a bit with program&#x27;s own architecture. I know it shouldn&#x27;t (thanks to the way tangling works), but it somehow does in my head.",

was technically homeless but I lived by magic for about four and a half
years.  It was pretty intense.   Anyway...<p>I speak with authority in this matter:<p>Astrology is a form of <i>divination</i>.  All forms of divination work,
depending on the operator.  All forms of: Astrology, Numerology, Tarot,
Dowsing by pendulum or rods, Palmistry, Reading of tea leaves or entrails
(yuch!) or cracks in heated turtle shells or thrown reeds or coins, I
Ching, omens and signs, etc., <i>all</i> of them, work by the same method.
It&#x27;s the internal potency of the operator that leads to correct knowledge
(from &quot;esoteric&quot; sources.)  Your own connection to source guides the
interpretation.  The format of the divination system is a conduit to
bring semantics into concrete syntax.<p>If you simply want reliable truthful information the &quot;applied
kinesiology&quot; technique of Dr. Sir David R. Hawkins, M.D., Ph.D. [1]  is
the single simplest and purest methodology.   It&#x27;s so mind-blowing that
even I can barely credit it.  But I have never found it to fail.  It&#x27;s so
spooky that I often &quot;forget&quot; to use it, and just bumble along as best i
can.  YMMV<p>However, if you want to study astrology, you can just make up your own system.
It will be more powerful than adopting someone else&#x27;s system.  <i>Unless</i>
you feel <i>drawn</i> to a certain school or format, in which case that&#x27;s
important information for your personal path and you should likely study
that.  Spread all your books out, pick one at random, open it to a random page, and read the first passage your eye alight upon.  (Bibliomancy, another form of divination, one of my favorites.  I have a shelf with the Gita, Bible, Beezlebub&#x27;s Tales to His Grandson, and others and still practice bibliomancy with them from time to time. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bibliomancy"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bibliomancy</a> )<p>[1] Although he didn&#x27;t invent it, his presentation and discussion of it

sculpture of a mind?<p>Divination is essentially a communion between the self and the Self (God,
Source, Universe, I don&#x27;t want to presume upon your beliefs) so if we
succeeded in making a person somehow, then yes, I believe it would have a
relationship with God beyond that of its constituent matter.<p>If not, if we can only mimic our own minds without kindling the spark of
life, then no, it would just be an elaborate dowsing rod, eh?<p>I think it might be possible to make a tulpa and associate it with a
mechanical form (physical or virtual) and there are corners on the
internet where people experiment with that.  The resulting entity would
be somewhat like a golem.  FWIW, I would advise against all that kind of
thing.<p>&gt; I don’t understand why you say it’s physics..and not mathematics.<p>Just that physics is the part of mathematics that maps to real world phenomenon.<p>&gt; Example: when I want to mow my cover crop field in spring, I simply do
if I get a feel for it. I know it’s not going to rain..I know it’s before
they have flowered, I know how the soil ‘feels’ before I can disc it. I
just know. I pick up a handful of soil and then at the sky, in a split
second I can make a decision.<p>That is the kind of thing where intelligence and intuition blend.  If you
keep going you&#x27;ll reach the place where you could be sitting deep in a
cave and still know.<p>FWIW, Tom Brown hints at this in some of his books on tracking.
<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tom_Brown_Jr"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tom_Brown_Jr</a>.<p>&gt; But for a machine to make that decision, mathematically..it needs weather
data, soil moisture data, leaf analysis, vision system data..put it all
together to say ‘yes, I will prep the field today’. The language is
mathematics.<p>&gt; In a way, I forecasted and predicted intuitively from previous years
springs to determine when I can prep the field. I could be wrong. A farm
machine AI however ..with math can make a decision based on narrow
parameters but will almost never be wrong because it only has to be right
within those narrow parameters.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that machine could be built, I think the variables
(including astrological influences) are too involved.  On the other hand,
your physical body including your brain could be considered to be that
machine already.  And that seems to bring up again the question of whether or
not you could make an artificial person with enough fidelity to the real
thing to develop intuition&#x2F;divination, eh?<p>I think it would be much easier to make a machine that allowed the plants
and soil itself to communicate the optimal times for events.<p>Do you have a copy of &quot;The Secret Life of Plants&quot;?

Bayesian AI then by all means I think that might help.  But
modern astrology is pretty much barren for the kind of thing you&#x27;re
talking about.<p>&gt; How can planets have an impact on humans..lets rephrase that..how can
planets not have an impact on humans? The sun does. The moon does. That’s
because we know heat and light are forms of energy. We acknowledge
gravitational force and tidal waves and electro magnetic forces. Does
this mean that there is nothing else? Perhaps there are forces we haven’t
even met yet and don’t know how it works.<p>I believe there are such &quot;subtle forces&quot; and that our periodic chart of the
elements is like a single octave of a much larger plenum of
matter&#x2F;energy&#x2F;frequency.  I&#x27;m following Gurdjieff here more-or-less.
But I know almost nothing about them.  There&#x27;s no modern source of reliable information on such things.<p>The problem is that we can only make machines out of the matter
we can touch.  You can&#x27;t make an instrument that responds to these
&quot;subtle energies&quot;.  Unless of course that&#x27;s exactly what these various
divination machines (Tarot, Astrology, Numerology, Dowsing, etc.) are
somehow doing.  (But personally I don&#x27;t think they are.)  And
again, your physical body inducing your brain is already an instrument
that responds to these &quot;subtle energies&quot; (if they exist.)<p>In the context of farm automation I would try making simple machines that
let the farm life communicate to them to activate various programs, based
on some of the stuff in &quot;The Secret Life of Plants&quot;.<p>Cheers!  Happy New Year.",

The UFOs fired light beams at people, causing injuries and sucking blood from 400 witnesses. After a rise in local concern, the mayor of the city requested help from the Air Force. Operation Saucer started, during which numerous photos were taken and testimonies collected. Operation Saucer is just one of the compelling cases which A. J. Gevaerd, editor of Brazilian UFO magazine, talked about in his latest lecture in Copenhagen, paving the way for complete Disclosure in his country.   Kudos to Exopolitics Denmark for setting up their excellent annual conference at the Danish National Museum on September 26 in Copenhagen!<p>The first case involves thousands of people, living on an island in the Amazon, who were attacked by UFOs over a period of several years (1975-1977 IIRC).  Flying cans with visible pilots were shooting people with bending &quot;light&quot; beams and sucking up their blood.  It got so bad that thousands of people evacuated and the Brazilian Army sent in a unit to find out what was going on and try to make contact.

itself.  As scientists point out, rightly, divination is logically
barren.  The intuition is something the operator does, the system of
astrology (or whatever) is just the markings on the dial.<p>You can&#x27;t understand intuition (if you could it would just be &quot;thinking&quot;)
only experience it.  Understanding and intuition are like sight and
hearing: two different but complimentary ways to sense&#x2F;model the Universe.<p>Does this help?<p>Really, if you just want to study astrology like an anthropologist would
then just read the books you have.  If you want to use astrology to model
the world you should instead use physics.  If you want to use astrology
to model the inner world then read e.g. &quot;Golden Bough&quot; and Jung&#x27;s
archetype work and his <i>Liber Novus</i> (aka The Red Book), and maybe &quot;The
Varieties of Religious Experience&quot; and &quot;The Perennial Philosophy&quot;.  And then just make up your own system.

Just enjoying a much simpler life based on minimalism. I also spend a very small fraction of the amount of money that I used to, I consider every purchase very carefully now.<p>For the past month I have been staying at a yoga retreat center in the mountain area north of Saigon. Clean fresh air, quiet, 2 hours of yoga every day, 2 good veggie meals, a lot of meditation and writing code for my day job and commenting on HN.<p>I don&#x27;t plan on writing a book...

On all of the roads, there is various livestock roaming freely. Goats, pigs, dogs, cats, chickens, buffalo, etc... they are either just on the street or in pens in peoples literal shacks by the side of the road.<p>When driving from south to north (towards China), at some point, you stop seeing pigs entirely. There are checkpoints every few km where you are required to drive through either a wet hole in the ground or over a wet burlap sack. At some places, they spray your tires. There are signs in the villages telling people to be careful.<p>Needless to say, for this reason and others, I&#x27;ve stopped eating meat in Vietnam unless I know it is imported from an expat owned restaurant. Even then, I&#x27;ve dialed back my meat consumption quite a bit. Eating street food has entirely lost its appeal.",

Gamers seem to be exceptionally forgiving and naive in this regard, and that lets games companies walk all over them.<p>Invasive rootkit DRM, games broken on launch, games broken <i>forever</i> with the expectation that community modders will donate their labor to fix it for free, games that don&#x27;t facilitate community servers, games that are split in two before launch with half the game being labeled &quot;DLC&quot;, thinly veiled skinner boxes designed like slot machines designed to encourage binge-play (&quot;grinding for rare loot&quot;) and sometimes designed to extract even more money from players who&#x27;ve already purchased the game (&quot;lootcrates&quot;.)  A DRM company, widely beloved by gamers, being forced by the courts to revise their abhorrent returns policy (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engadget.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;12&#x2F;23&#x2F;valve-steam-fined-2-million-australia-refund-policy&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engadget.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;12&#x2F;23&#x2F;valve-steam-fined-2-mill...</a>) Shit, I&#x27;ve had &#x27;gamers&#x27; get fuming mad at me before for not worshiping at the altar of Valve, as though it were <i>religious heresy</i> for me to criticize a <i>for-profit American corporation</i>.<p>Even when the &#x27;gamer community&#x27; recognizes something as broken, they seem to forget by the time the next game comes around.  Just look at the history of Bethesda releases.  Morrowind was broken but somewhat novel.  Oblivion was again broken, though perhaps with some of the edges rounded over.  Next was Fallout 3, which was still broken.  Skyrim was very broken, at this point the pattern should have been obvious to everybody paying attention, and to be fair to the gamers the brokenness of Bethesda games was becoming a meme at this point.  Fallout 4 comes around and it&#x27;s their most nerfed game yet, but still broken as fuck.  How could anybody be surprised at this point?  Yet people still bought that, and they even bought the next game, Fallout 76, which was the most egregiously Bethesda broken game yet.  Currently the &#x27;gamer community&#x27; recognizes Fallout 76 and Bethesda as dumpster fires, but will they buy the next Bethesda game?  I&#x27;d bet on it.  When it comes time to vote with their wallets, I wager they&#x27;ll be compliant consumers and do as the marketing tells them to.  Even when they learn, they don&#x27;t learn.  The lesson doesn&#x27;t set in, a new game is released, and the cycle continues.",

As you can see the syscall is only done in the slow path.<p>On a futex release, the simple solution is to always invoke futex signal syscall after setting the lock bit to zero[1]. To fast path the relase, a wait bit can be set on the acquire path just before calling futex wait, so on the release path, when setting the lock bit to zero, signal would only be called if the waiter bit was set (and the cleared by together with the lock bit)[2].<p>As you can see the futex syscall is already the slow path and never need to be onvoked in the uncontented case. In fact the kernel doesn&#x27;t even need to know about the futex untill the first contention.<p>[1] futexes are edge triggered, same as condition variables, so a signal will only wakes any thread blocked ona wait that happened-before the signal call. Thus there is a race condition if a lock rrlease and signal happens between the failed acquire attempt and the wait call; to prevent this futex wait as an additional parameter that is the expected value of the memory location: the kernel checks the futex address against this valur and will only if it hasn&#x27;t changed will put the thread to sleep (this is done atomically).<p>[2] as there could me multiple waiters, a broadcast is actually needed here which leads to a thundering herd as all waiters will race to acquire the lock.

They annex every age to their own; all the years that have gone before them are an addition to their store. Unless we are most ungrateful, all those men, glorious fashioners of holy thoughts, were born for us; for us they have prepared a way of life. By other men&#x27;s labours we are led to the sight of things most beautiful that have been wrested from darkness and brought into light; from no age are we shut out, we have access to all ages, and if it is our wish, by greatness of mind, to pass beyond the narrow limits of human weakness, there is a great stretch of time through which we may roam. We may argue with Socrates, we may doubt with Carneades, find peace with Epicurus, overcome human nature with the Stoics, exceed it with the Cynics. Since Nature allows us to enter into fellowship with every age, why should we not turn from this paltry and fleeting span of time and surrender ourselves with all our soul to the past, which is boundless, which is eternal, which we share with our betters?<p>But we may fairly say that they alone are engaged in the true duties of life who shall wish to have Zeno, Pythagoras, Democritus, and all the other high priests of liberal studies, and Aristotle and Theophrastus, as their most intimate friends every day. No one of these will be &quot;not at home,&quot; no one of these will fail to have his visitor leave more happy and more devoted to himself than when he came, no one of these will allow anyone to leave him with empty hands; all mortals can meet with them by night or by day.<p>No one of these will force you to die, but all will teach you how to die; no one of these will wear out your years, but each will add his own years to yours; conversations with no one of these will bring you peril, the friendship of none will endanger your life, the courting of none will tax your purse. From them you will take whatever you wish; it will be no fault of theirs if you do not draw the utmost that you can desire. What happiness, what a fair old age awaits him who has offered himself as a client to these! He will have friends from whom he may seek counsel on matters great and small, whom he may consult every day about himself, from whom he may hear truth without insult, praise without flattery, and after whose likeness he may fashion himself.<p>We are wont to say that it was not in our power to choose the parents who fell to our lot, that they have been given to men by chance; yet we may be the sons of whomsoever we will. Households there are of noblest intellects; choose the one into which you wish to be adopted; you will inherit not merely their name, but even their property, which there will be no need to guard in a mean or niggardly spirit; the more persons you share it with, the greater it will become. These will open to you the path to immortality, and will raise you to a height from which no one is cast down. This is the only way of prolonging mortality—nay, of turning it into immortality. Honours, monuments, all that ambition has commanded by decrees or reared in works of stone, quickly sink to ruin; there is nothing that the lapse of time does not tear down and remove. But the works which philosophy has consecrated cannot be harmed; no age will destroy them, no age reduce them; the following and each succeeding age will but increase the reverence for them, since envy works upon what is close at hand, and things that are far off we are more free to admire. The life of the philosopher, therefore, has wide range, and he is not confined by the same bounds that shut others in. He alone is freed from the limitations of the human race; all ages serve him as if a god. Has some time passed by? This he embraces by recollection. Is time present? This he uses. Is it still to come? This he anticipates. He makes his life long by combining all times into one.",

Formally called a &quot;Compensated Price&quot; and a &quot;National (or Consumer) Dividend&quot;, a National Credit Office would be charged with the task of calculating the size of the rebate and dividend by determining a national balance sheet, and calculating aggregate production and consumption statistics.&quot;<p>&quot;Based on his conclusion that the real cost of production is less than the financial cost of production, the Douglas price rebate (Compensated Price) is determined by the ratio of consumption to production. Since consumption over a period of time is typically less than production over the same period of time in any industrial society, the real cost of goods should be less than the financial cost.<p>For example, if the money cost of a good is $100, and the ratio of consumption to production is 3&#x2F;4, then the real cost of the good is $100(3&#x2F;4) = $75. As a result, if a consumer spent $100 for a good, the National Credit Authority would rebate the consumer $25. The good costs the consumer $75, the retailer receives $100, and the consumer receives the difference of $25 via new credits created by the National Credit Authority.<p>The National Dividend is justified by the displacement of labour in the productive process due to technological increases in productivity. As human labour is increasingly replaced by machines in the productive process, Douglas believed people should be free to consume while enjoying increasing amounts of leisure, and that the Dividend would provide this freedom.&quot;",

We already have widely diversified ownership, with index funds and pension funds, so why not take it all the way?<p>However, the total value of the S&amp;P 500 (which is probably about half the world stock markets value) is about $26 trillion, so that is about $3400 per person or maybe double or triple for a family. And the dividend of 1.75% means an income of $60&#x2F;year if you hold on to the stock.<p>So I think doing this redistribution would result in everybody to whom $3400 is a lot immediately selling (assuming they were allowed to). I&#x27;m not sure what the distribution of capital would end up being. Someone would buy, say &quot;Barren Wuffet&quot; who fortunately had all their investments in cash, bonds, and small cap stocks. So ownership would end up being concentrated again, but maybe not as concentrated.<p>Anyone who has a lot of money saved for retirement in a large-cap fund would be unhappy, but why should you be better off than an average citizen of the world?<p>It seems like a fine experiment to me.<p>Edit: but just to spell it out, obviously politically impossible given the consequences for first world people who are relatively privileged but don&#x27;t think of themselves that way.

For example, &quot;serverless&quot; is used by some people to refer to a more concrete and specific and well established concept of Function-as-a-Service (FaaS). Yet, albeit FaaS is portraied as a subset of &quot;serverless&quot; concept, FaaS does not represent the concept, which is assumed to be more broadly defined.<p>This ambiguity and vagueness opens the door to discussions on whether pain old &quot;managed services&quot; warrant the &quot;serverless&quot; buzzword, which would underline the buzzword factor by the way an old and well established concept is being rebranded. Then there are futile discussions on whether irrelevant and secondary implementation details of managed services, such as the degree of automation and auto-scaling, are in line with what is true &quot;servelessness&quot;.<p>But in the end this collective grasping at straws just underlines the lack of substance behind the &quot;serverless&quot; keyword.",

Function-as-a-service (FaaS) is an objective, clear-cut concept, but &quot;serverless computing&quot; is supposed to be a more general term where FaaS is only a realization of the concept.  Yet, by keeping the concept as a buzzword then the proponents actually avoid having to argue the merits and the advantages of this sort of architecture, thus contributing to the growing skepticism.",

Yes, it&#x27;s expensive.  We&#x27;re in a day and age where a vCPU with 2GB of RAM can be had for 3€&#x2F;month, and the pricing examples posted on AWS Lambda&#x27;s page show a scenario where slightly over a month of function run time requiring 512MB of RAM would cost around $18.<p>In addition, AWS lambda usage is rounded up in intervals of 0.1s and 128MB, thus inexpensive function calls are way overcharged.<p>&gt; If you’re spending even $100 a month on lambda, you probably have a successful business.<p>This assertion is missing the fact that those $100 a month on lambdas might be handled by $10 worth of computational resources in the cloud and a software architecture that isn&#x27;t convoluted or tied to a single vendor.

In fact, it&#x27;s just an appeal to popularity mixed with a touch of appeal to authority.  Technologies should be judged by their technical merits.<p>&gt;  In many cases, it can be cost efficient, or even (human) resource efficient to use a serverless setup.<p>The argument in favor of the cost effectiveness of Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) offerings is exclusively in the side of the service provider.  By convincing clients to give up reserving VM instances and instead switch to a glorified batch job service, service providers are able to increase their capacity with the exact same infrastructure.  That&#x27;s the main selling point.  Afterwards, charging customers a premium to use the service is a secondary bonus.<p>&gt; So it gets quite repetitive to still be debating that, yes, we know there are servers running the code, it&#x27;s just a name.<p>Again, this line of argument is simply silly and entirely misses (or worse, avoids) the actual criticism being directed at  the whole &quot;serverless&quot; fad.  It&#x27;suite bluntly  nothing more than a strawman.<p>&gt; Also, a lot of the value in serverless lies in time saved managing said servers<p>This whole line of argument also makes no sense once we factor in the fact that containerization is a thing and nowadays launching web services is as hard as launching a batch job.  In fact, some container orchestration services already support plain old batch jobs through Docker containers. Just build a container with your &quot;serverless&quot; code, launch the container, let the &quot;serverless&quot; code do its thing, and wait until completion.

Nor do I think that win-percentages are the only metric we have to work with -- most multiplayer games have reams of much better data to sort through, particularly in games with high variability of play-styles, player types, and team compositions and setups (games like League&#x2F;Hearthstone&#x2F;Overwatch, etc...)<p>That being said, I would be more amiable to a system that used player skill as a matchmaking tool if it didn&#x27;t report those numbers to players.<p>However, I&#x27;m not sure I would say that sorting and reporting is usually a side effect or minor mistake on top of those systems, given that many of these games have seasons, rewards, an entire meta-game built on top of their rankings. The rankings aren&#x27;t just serving the purpose of getting players matched together -- they&#x27;re serving as player motivators. The responses that players have can&#x27;t be seen as a purely accidental side-effect when designers are going out of their way to present this information to the player and to encourage the player to pay attention to it.<p>Hearthstone is a good example here. Hearthstone has <i>brilliant</i> design, but its ladder system is horrible and dumb. It explicitly encourages net-decking and grinding instead of experimentation. Fast decks are objectively better than slow ones with the same win percentage, because ranking is largely determined by win percentage combined with the number of games you can fit into a season.<p>Season rewards are then tied to rank, so the best way to get new cards if you want to experiment is to build a boring deck and grind. This is despite the fact that for most players, knowing within the first few turns whether or not they&#x27;re going to win is not fun.<p>So of course people bot Hearthstone, because before you can build creative fun decks and play against interesting people with interesting strategies, you have to pay the &quot;fun tax&quot; of grinding on the ladder. Everything brilliant about Hearthstone is bogged down by being tied to this kind of toxic experience.<p>There&#x27;s no way to say this about such a popular game without sounding naive, and I&#x27;ll take the criticism, but I do not believe for one second it would be difficult to build a better public ranking system for Hearthstone, especially given the ludicrous amount of player data they have. Even something as simple as balancing rank with deck variety so players got fewer rewards the more times they played the same cards would go a huge way towards getting rid of net-decking.<p>These systems do increase engagement among very invested players, so maybe that&#x27;s the only intention. But to heck with engagement -- is laddering at the higher ranks of Hearthstone <i>fun</i>? People do it, people say they enjoy it. Again, I&#x27;ll take the criticism a statement like this warrants, but I don&#x27;t believe them. I don&#x27;t believe the experience of grinding a single 55% win-rate deck for hours and hours is an experience that is worth having or producing.<p>And when I think about why players do that, the only cause that comes to my mind is, &quot;the game tells them to.&quot;",

Chrome will still be the dominant browser. (0.7)<p>No other browser will have passed Chrome in market share. This doesn&#x27;t mean they won&#x27;t be making progress, just that 10 years is not enough time for anyone to catch up.<p>4. Javascript will still be the dominant language on the web. (0.95)<p>WASM will open up a lot of interesting opportunities and make a lot of cool technologies possible. Most web devs will ignore it, and most web coding will still be done in Javascript. Sorry, Bernhardt.<p>5. PCs will still be around, people will still buy laptops. (0.9)<p>The mass migration to tablets and obsoletion of PCs that people have been talking about forever will still not have happened. The PC&#x27;s place as a non-niche, common consumer device will be reinforced by the continued rise of convertible laptops, which will make tablets less distinct and less attractive on metrics other than cost.<p>-----------------<p>Risky predictions<p>-----------------<p>6. Krita (specifically Krita) will become reasonably competitive with programs like Clip Studio. (0.35)<p>Krita will occupy the same space as Blender, in which it will be regarded by the general public as a similarly viable, serious contender with professional programs.<p>7. Matrix will become a defacto standard in the Open Source &amp; security community over platforms like Signal, Wire, etc... (0.3)<p>Interoperability and more open clients will cause a snowball effect. Platforms like Signal will still have better security, but that won&#x27;t matter.

Apple will swallow its pride and make a convertible Macbook with a touchscreen. (0.4)<p>The argument that consumers widely don&#x27;t want touchscreens on Laptops will become impossible to defend. There will be a Macbook that has one, and it will probably be a convertible.

Proponents of breaking up tech giants would argue that Twitter and Facebook are not actually very good products right now, and the reason they&#x27;re popular is largely due to network effects and anticompetitive behavior, not innovation. They would argue that even if breaking up Twitter just resulted in 2nd-best Twitter, the existence of competition would force the original Twitter to innovate at a faster pace than it&#x27;s moving right now.<p>Second, you assume that there would be a clear &quot;best&quot; product. In truly competitive fields, it&#x27;s often difficult to point to one product and say, &quot;that&#x27;s the best, and everyone else is settling for a worse product.&quot;<p>Take iPhone and Android. Why does anyone use the 2nd best phone operating system? Why don&#x27;t we have one OS? Because there isn&#x27;t a clear 2nd best operating system. The products are good for different things, and fit different niches and use-cases. It seems obvious to me that the smartphone market is broad enough that other niches could be served better by more targeted alternatives to the two major OSes, if those alternatives were allowed to mature to the point where they became competitive.<p>Finally, you misunderstand what the proposals about breaking up tech companies often entail. Most commonly when people talk about breaking up big-tech, I find they&#x27;re talking about Warren. Warren&#x27;s proposals are (roughly speaking) about separating product offerings and platforms. Her plan isn&#x27;t to take Apple and force them to split up and create a second iOS. Her plan is to split Apple so that the company controlling the iOS App Store isn&#x27;t the same company selling software on that store.<p>It&#x27;s not about blindly making a second Apple, it&#x27;s about trying to remove conflicts of interest from platform maintainers.<p>I&#x27;m not going to say whether or not I think that plan is good.

I admit that&#x27;s fringe, and I&#x27;m not going to fight people over it. But I can&#x27;t imagine myself ever designing a system like that for any of my games.<p>First, I think these systems ignore technical realities, and design has to pay attention to real-world constraints. Blocking cheaters is insanely hard, and almost no real-time games that I know of do it at what I believe is an acceptable level.<p>It&#x27;s a nice idea that I don&#x27;t think is technically supported, in the same way that it would be a nice idea if my photorealistic MMO didn&#x27;t have loading screens anywhere and loaded everything instantly. It&#x27;s not good design to spend a bunch of effort hinging your game design on something that&#x27;s not technically possible for you to do.<p>Second, I think these systems ignore player incentives. I think that global competitive ranking encourages the worst of playerbases, that skill is an arbitrary mechanism to optimize on instead of something like how close each match was, or player-reported satisfaction levels, or variety of play-styles, or any other of a dozen other metrics.<p>Third, caring about bots radically shrinks your design space. You can&#x27;t have exploits, players have to have a &quot;right&quot; way to play, modding has to be more limited. It shrinks the game not only in the sense that it makes your systems more complicated -- it fundamentally shrinks what your game can do as a <i>game</i>, and how your game can evolve with the rest of the medium.<p>Finally, not only is skill not a particularly rewarding metric to optimize on when what you really want is for your players to have fun, most of the problems with automation explicitly only are a problem for competitive matchmaking. If you&#x27;re optimizing for player-reported satisfaction, you probably don&#x27;t <i>care</i> if people are botting your game, because successful bots will be optimizing for creating good matches instead of for just winning[0].<p>Personal plug, with my current project, Loop Thesis, LAN play is the only multiplayer. I only want people to play with friends, and I&#x27;m not trying to build some kind of community or network.

My personal take now has become that 90% of the time these systems are a design antipattern.<p>It&#x27;s counterproductive. I want players playing my game to have fun. I have to ban bots because they make the game not fun. The reason the bots make the game not fun is because all of my design hinges fun on giving players an optimization problem that I explicitly don&#x27;t want them to solve in creative ways. The bots are solving the optimization problem <i>too well</i>. So getting rid of that optimization problem, getting rid of the rankings, makes so many other design&#x2F;engineering problems go away.

Recommendation systems on all of these platforms are abysmal, and they don&#x27;t seem to be improving -- they seem to be getting worse. Most changes being made on sites like Twitter are poorly received by users. When the last time there was a change on Twitter that everyone liked?<p>Most of these sites are slow. Gmail is actively getting slower over time, to the point where it now has an extra loading screen. It&#x27;s not clear to me what features have been added to justify that.<p>On sites like Youtube, creators are now at the point where they view the website like an existential threat. Youtube provides almost no real mechanisms for creators to fight copyright claims, its monetization rules and promotion algorithms are opaque and difficult to navigate.<p>Again, it&#x27;s subjective whether you should look at that kind of stuff and say, &quot;well no one could do it better.&quot; I look at platforms like Mastodon and say, &quot;well, clearly some people are doing stuff like moderation and open API access better than sites like Twitter&#x2F;Facebook.&quot; I look at sites like Nitter and think, &quot;well, if one person built this, and even as just a blind proxy it seems to work better than Twitter&#x27;s site in multiple ways, then Twitter isn&#x27;t trying very hard.&quot;<p>&gt; Can you give any examples of anticompetitive behavior exhibited by social media companies?<p>On Facebook: the email dump that came out late 2019[0] is a good place to start. In it, you can see Facebook design &quot;open&quot; data APIs where access was restricted to partners who spent certain amounts of money on ads. Companies that were considered competitive with Facebook&#x27;s offerings were excluded from that already problematic agreement. If Facebook saw you as a potential threat, you were essentially banned from the platform.<p>On Instagram: users were threatened with loss of status and verification if they linked to other platforms in their bios[1]. Eventually, the code was changed to detect &quot;add me&quot; links and outright block them from being included on bios at all. This is a very bold, open attempt to hold a userbase hostage, counting on the fact that Instagram&#x2F;WhatsApp users have too much to lose to go against the policy.<p>I know you specifically asked about social media, but if I can broaden that out a tiny bit: on Google&#x27;s front, Chrome is advertised prominently in every one of Google&#x27;s products, for free. Google offerings are also built to work best in Chrome even to the point of breaking standards[2].<p>This kind of &quot;by default&quot; push for Chrome on Android devices and in Google products is, in my mind, very reminiscent of the IE antitrust case the Microsoft got slammed with.<p>We could go on, but I don&#x27;t want this to get too long. But it really shouldn&#x27;t be difficult for you to imagine why someone might claim tech giants are anticompetitive, even if you disagree with those reasons. Heck, a new accusation gets posted to HN at least once a week -- just look at the conversations around AMP&#x27;s search-result placement.<p>&gt; If the &quot;original&quot; twitter kept the twitter brand and domain, absolutely nothing would change since that would be the equivalent of the status quo.<p>Based on Facebook&#x27;s reactions to Instagram, Snapchat, and other similar competitors, this isn&#x27;t the case. Every time Facebook has felt threatened by a competitor, in the brief period before they bought them, they were forced to uptake user-friendly features. In regards to Snapchat, some of those features were more privacy-friendly than what Facebook was currently offering.<p>A better argument that I&#x27;d be more sympathetic to here would be that Facebook already regularly feels the pressure of competition, and breaking them up isn&#x27;t necessary. But it seems strange to me to argue that competition wouldn&#x27;t do anything at all, given that we have a lot of examples of competition making these platforms better.<p>&gt; Right, but those products exist because they serve a niche in the market, simply breaking up companies doesn&#x27;t create a niche.<p>No, but simply having an unserved niche in the market also doesn&#x27;t mean a product will fill it. That&#x27;s what people are getting at, that there are niches that would be filled by competing OSes and products if there weren&#x27;t anticompetetive forces keeping those products from existing.<p>You need two things for a niche product to exist -- you need a real niche that&#x27;s unmet, and you need an opportunity to create that product. Proponents of breaking up big-tech argue that we have the first, and not the second.<p>Once again, I think there is a case to be made that the situation isn&#x27;t as bad as people say -- that we do have competitors starting to pop up for Facebook&#x2F;Twitter, and talk about forcing the market is unnecessary right now. I&#x27;m not going to get into that argument, but I don&#x27;t think the people who make it are dumb.<p>&gt; Would Valve be allowed to sell 1st party software on Steam? Would Google be allowed to sell their software on the play store?<p>Roughly speaking, that&#x27;s the intent. Google would be able to sell software on the Play store, but then Google couldn&#x27;t <i>own</i> the Play store, it would need to be spun out into another company.<p>Similar rules have been proposed for media companies and ISPs; people argue that a company like T-Mobile shouldn&#x27;t be able to simultaneously operate an Internet service and merge with a media provider on that service -- that would create a conflict of interest that would threaten Net Neutrality.<p>This sounds extreme on the software front because we have a pretty long history of companies doing exactly that -- creating a search engine and then using it to promote Chrome, creating a Play store and then using it to make sure that Gmail has prominent placement.

If your players knew how to design a game, they would be game designers.<p>One of the big reasons design is so hard is because you&#x27;re trying to understand another person&#x27;s motivations better than they themselves do. Feedback shouldn&#x27;t be ignored, but neither should it be implemented verbatim. Players just aren&#x27;t good at sussing out their own motivations -- they&#x27;ll tell you, &quot;we want more rewards for ranked&quot; instead of &quot;we don&#x27;t want to feel obligated to dip into unrelated game modes&quot;, or &quot;we want to feel more like we&#x27;re progressing towards something.&quot;<p>Players also aren&#x27;t good at giving feedback about what feels wrong, their feedback instead takes the form of half-thought ideas of how to fix what feels wrong. Responding to that feedback means digging under it to find out the actual problem and addressing that specifically.<p>Note that this isn&#x27;t just me talking. Rosewater himself has talked about this phenomenon a lot in his design blog on MTG, and he has a good quote on this[0]:<p>&gt; The key is whether or not what the players want will in the end make them happy. Players ask for things all the time that if we actually gave them would make the game less enjoyable for them. We do spend a lot of time trying to understand what they players want, though, because when we are able to give players things they want, we do.<p>The point being, I have no doubt that if MTG Arena announced tomorrow that it was getting rid of ranked rewards and seasons, the playerbase would be <i>livid</i>. I still suspect an alternate system for rewards would be better in the long run.<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;magic.wizards.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;articles&#x2F;archive&#x2F;making-magic&#x2F;say-when-2014-12-08"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;magic.wizards.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;articles&#x2F;archive&#x2F;making-magic&#x2F;s...</a>",

Experimenting on the ladder is not only bad for your rank, it&#x27;s also likely to get you reported by other teammates as a feeder (see the toxicity mentioned above).<p>Players are effectively optimizers. If you give them a system with a clear success metric (ie, a public rank going up), they will optimize their play-style to fit that system.

They won&#x27;t bot a competitive game because that&#x27;s not fun for other players.<p>Most players don&#x27;t think in those terms during gameplay (myself included). Thinking that way is hard.

When everyone has a 1TH&#x2F;s miner that consumes 1kWh and suddenly a 10TH&#x2F;s miner that consumes 1kWh comes out everyone is going to switch to the new miner. Because Bitcoin guarantees that a block is mined every 10 minutes it has to make the calculation 10x harder than before. The end result? The energy consumption didn&#x27;t change.<p>What makes Bitcoin more energy intensive then? The price of Bitcoin. When the price of Bitcoin doubles that also means the mining profit doubles. More miners (= more energy consumption) join the blockchain until the profit margin is back to the previous level. The price of a Bitcoin is 70x higher than the price of Ethereum so that suggests that Bitcoin should use 70x more energy.,

Private filing means that everyone is very aware of how much they’re paying in taxes. It’s not just an invoice they receive listing how much was withheld. They have to recalculate it.

Yes, if taxes were just paying an invoice at the end of the year, that would make them less noticeable, but that&#x27;s not a necessary component of private taxation.

The goal is to attempt to reproduce experiments until the product of the P-values of the results reaches a target aggregate P. Note that this target applies to P and P&#x27;.<p>Example 1: Your target P is P=0.01. You perform an experiment, get a P=0.3 result. Then you attempt to reproduce, and get a P=0.4 result, for an aggregate P of 0.12. You then attempt to reproduce again, and get a P=0.2 result, for an aggregate P of 0.024. Finally, you attempt to reproduce again, and get a P=0.4 result, for an aggregate P of 0.0096, below your target P.

You then attempt to reproduce, with a P=0.9 result, for an aggregate P&#x27; of P&#x27;=(0.03 x 0.1)=0.003, below your target P.

First, it demonstrates that you can find fairly conclusive confidence values eventually from aggregating experiments with fairly inconclusive results. Second, it demonstrates that the P=0.05 that&#x27;s frequently used now is actually a very low bar of confidence, when you consider that reproducing even very unsurprising results a few times gives you a much higher confidence.",

I think you could conservatively use fewer confirmations, but there&#x27;s a bunch of network analysis you&#x27;d have to do to calculate what the probability of a transaction not being included in N sequential blocks simply due to network instability. I didn&#x27;t do that network analysis, so you might need more or fewer confirmations to be reasonably sure that censorship is occurring and not just network instability.<p>&gt; I assumed you meant manually. This method isn&#x27;t possible to automate under PoW, because any such actions require global time, but PoW is what provides time itself, creating a contradiction. What this means in practice is network splits.<p>I don&#x27;t think you need global time to do this. More on this later in this post.<p>&gt; as what would happen is nodes that were online and observed the situation would follow one chain, but everyone else that joins later wouldn&#x27;t be able to confirm that censorship actually happened, and follow another. If you have a solution that solves it, you solved the fundamental problem - absolute order - some other way and PoW becomes completely superfluous.<p>This situation resolves itself naturally via the mechanism I proposed.<p>Let&#x27;s follow the scenario you propose and see how it resolves. The following events happen in this order:<p>1. The Chinese government decides to censor transactions from a certain address, refusing to accept blocks which include transactions from that address.<p>2. A transaction from that address is broadcasted.<p>3. Chinese miners mine 5 blocks that don&#x27;t contain the transaction. Nodes which have been on the network the whole time notice the censored transaction, and go to the next-longest chain, creating a fork.<p>4. A new node joins the network. From the new node&#x27;s perspective, there are two chains, but the Chinese one is longer so you go with that. However, you still have the signed transactions from the shorter chain, and your node notices that the Chinese chain doesn&#x27;t contain some of those transactions. At the time of joining, as far as you know, that transaction simply hasn&#x27;t been included in the longest chain yet.<p>5. Chinese miners mine 5 more blocks that don&#x27;t contain the transaction. The newly-added node now notices the censored transaction, rendering the current chain <i>invalid</i>, and goes to the longest <i>valid</i> chain, which is the one everyone else was on. Consistency achieved.<p>The implication of this solution is that when you join the network, you now have to wait for 5 confirmations to ensure none of the transactions you have are being censored in the longest chain (i.e. it takes 5 confirmations to know that the longest chain is valid). Which is certainly an important implication!<p>Note that absolute order doesn&#x27;t matter here. We don&#x27;t have to know the order of the transaction, only that it has existed for some number of blocks without being included in the chain.<p>&gt; Then there&#x27;s a problem of: what happens when there are contradictory transactions on two different chains at once? How do you decide which one is valid? This gets complex very fast.<p>The way you&#x27;ve worded it, that&#x27;s not really all that complex--that&#x27;s the same as a double spend, and it&#x27;s resolved the same way any other contradictory transaction is resolved: follow the longest (valid) chain (where part of the definition is &quot;valid&quot; is &quot;containing all transactions I&#x27;ve had for 5 confirmations&quot;).<p>However, I think you might have left out part of what you meant here, so I&#x27;ll try to explain what I think you&#x27;re hinting at. There&#x27;s a sophisticated way for China to hide their attack. It works like this:<p>1.  The Chinese government decides to censor transactions from a certain address, refusing to accept blocks which include transactions from that address.<p>2. A transaction from that address is broadcasted. We&#x27;ll call this the censored transaction.<p>3. Non-Chinese miners mine a block that includes the censored transaction. This becomes the root of what we&#x27;ll call the censored branch.<p>4. Chinese miners ignore the mined block that includes the censored transaction, and mine a block which doesn&#x27;t contain the transaction. This block becomes the root of a branch we&#x27;ll call the red herring branch. In that block, they include a transaction which they never broadcasted to the network. We&#x27;ll call this the red herring transaction.<p>5. Due to superior Chinese mining capability, the red herring chain quickly becomes longer. However, after 5 confirmations, the network notices the censored transaction isn&#x27;t being included in the red herring chain. So they invalidate the red herring chain and go to the longest <i>valid</i> chain, which is the censored chain.<p>6. 4 more blocks are mined on the censored chain.<p>7. A new node joins the network.<p>8. At this point, the censored branch doesn&#x27;t include the red herring transaction, and the red herring branch doesn&#x27;t include the censored transaction. So our previous resolution strategy doesn&#x27;t work, because we don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s the red herring transaction or the censored transaction that&#x27;s being censored.<p>First, I want to say, this is a really sophisticated attack and I want to congratulate you for coming up with it.<p>Second, I think this problem can be solved by sweeping up ALL the transactions in EVERY block you receive, even if they are in blocks which haven&#x27;t been confirmed, and treat them as if they were broadcast to you on the network. This way, the red herring transaction gets included into the censored branch. This gives us a new resolution:<p>1.  The Chinese government decides to censor transactions from a certain address, refusing to accept blocks which include transactions from that address.<p>2. A transaction from that address is broadcasted. We&#x27;ll call this the censored transaction.<p>3. Non-Chinese miners mine a block that includes the censored transaction. This becomes the root of what we&#x27;ll call the censored branch.<p>4. Chinese miners ignore the mined block that includes the censored transaction, and mine a block which doesn&#x27;t contain the transaction. This block becomes the root of a branch we&#x27;ll call the red herring branch. In that block, they include a transaction which they never broadcasted to the network. We&#x27;ll call this the red herring transaction.<p>5. Due to superior Chinese mining capability, the red herring chain quickly becomes longer. However, after 5 confirmations, the network notices the censored transaction isn&#x27;t being included in the red herring chain. So they invalidate the red herring chain and go to the longest <i>valid</i> chain, which is the censored chain.<p>6. A new block is mined on the censored chain. Since we&#x27;ve swept up all the transactions from the red herring chain, this block includes the red herring transaction.<p>7. A new node joins the network and assumes the red herring chain is the longest valid chain.<p>8. After 5 blocks, the new node sees the red herring chain does not contain the censored transaction, invalidates the red herring chain, and goes to the longest valid chain, which is the censored chain.

Change in strength is dependent on the cord material and weave. Stiffer cord will lose more strength when tied, while more supple cord will maintain its strength better. The tradeoff is that supple cord is more susceptible to tangling. Citing one number as a strength loss for different knots is <i>sure</i> to be false. I would guess, for example, that your cotton twine sees less percentage loss in strength in both knots than your jute.<p>2. The change in strength is also dependent on the sharpness of the folds in the material. A sharper turn is weaker than a rounder one. If you tie a knot <i>around</i> something, that decreases the sharpness of the turns, which is going to increase the strength of the knots. We aren&#x27;t typically just tying an overhand or figure 8 midline in a knot and pulling on the ends--I can&#x27;t think of ANY place where that&#x27;s useful. The closest thing I can think of is a stopper knot, and neither of these knots is ideal for that application. I&#x27;d expect to see a higher loss of strength with flat overhand&#x2F;flat figure 8, than with a ring bend&#x2F;flemish bend (which correspond to the overhand and figure 8). This is because the weakest points in the flat knots is the turn entering the knot, whereas the retraced bend versions of these knots, the cord enters the knot in a straight line.<p>3. Breaking is often not the largest source of failure. A flat figure 8 will roll and come untied long before the cord breaks in most materials, while the flat usually binds within 1-3 rolls. The breaking load of a flat overhand is much, much higher than the rolling load of a flat figure 8 in climbing ropes I&#x27;ve tried it with.",

But in its defense, it is an easy to do micro-benchmark with consistent results.<p>That&#x27;s fair, and it does prove that different knots affect strength differently. That&#x27;s a base principle that is useful to know even if it doesn&#x27;t get you far on its own.<p>With regards to your application: while it lacks the &quot;finesse&quot; of tying knots that give you just enough strength, simply getting stronger twine would solve this problem without the complexity.<p>In general, there&#x27;s a whole lot of ways knots can fail. If you can solve the problem by just using stronger cord, that frees up mental cycles for dressing, avoiding slippage, effective communication, ease of untying, etc. If you&#x27;re just tying up boxes do whatever you feel like doing. But for climbing, I&#x27;d rather have the rope be more than strong enough to do its job, and have those brain cycles for focusing on preventing other system failures.",

Reorgs are already possible, this is why we currently wait for some number of confirmations (6 last time I checked) to say a transaction is complete. Adding the condition of requiring all transactions you&#x27;ve received to be included in a chain means that you need to wait for more confirmations to reach the same level of confidence that the chain is final, but it doesn&#x27;t mean finality will never happen.<p>With a perfect network where everyone receives all transactions immediately, and where transactions are prioritizes for inclusion by transaction fee first, and order received second, we can conclude after ONE block whether a transaction with a high enough transaction fee is being excluded. But the network <i>isn&#x27;t</i> perfect. There&#x27;s some network analysis to be done here to gather probabilities, but for the sake of simplicity, let&#x27;s say the network is reliable enough that we can reasonably conclude whether a transaction is being excluded in 5 blocks (I think the number is actually lower, but let&#x27;s go with 5 to be safe).<p>So basically, what we&#x27;re saying here is that if we reject the fifth block that doesn&#x27;t contain a transaction after we see it, then we&#x27;re forcing a reorg.<p>The attack you&#x27;re describing happens when someone waits for China to start ignoring a transaction, then attempts to use the resulting reorg to execute a double spend.<p>Last time I checked, the recommendation was to wait for 6 confirmations to prevent double spends, because it would be unreasonable for an attacker to attempt to catch up to the main block chain when the main blockchain has a 6-block head start. But if China forces a reorg after 5 blocks, then the attacker attempting to execute the double spend only needs to catch up 1 block.<p>Trivially, all this means is that we have to wait for 5+6 = 11 confirmations to achieve the same level of confidence that we got from 6 confirmations when China couldn&#x27;t force a reorg.<p>But wait: China actually can&#x27;t force a reorg that quickly with 100% probability. In order to force this reorg, China has to mine 5 blocks in a row. China only has 66% of hashing power, so the probability of China mining a given block is P=0.66. The chances of China mining N blocks in a row is P=0.66^N. So the probability of China even being able to force this reorg is P=0.66^5=0.13.<p>That&#x27;s not nothing, but that&#x27;s a lot of effort for China to put in just for a 13% chance of <i>delaying</i> a transaction. Given China can&#x27;t actually censor the transaction, only delay it, why would they spend all those hashing cycles to do this? The incentives don&#x27;t line up.",

In principle, that&#x27;s an Obviously Good Thing. But you have to question whether that information is actually as conclusive as you want it to be, and whether you&#x27;re changing the outcome by observing it. There&#x27;s two problems with the information you gather by making phone calls and showing mockups&#x2F;designs:<p>1. Mocks&#x2F;designs only communicate a fraction of the product, and often the parts that aren&#x27;t visible in mocks&#x2F;designs are the most valuable parts of the product. Speaking in vague terms: I&#x27;m working on an app where the main value is that it calculates actionable numeric values that users typically calculate in spreadsheets. The UI is certainly a selling point, but users aren&#x27;t going to easily understand the connection between the new UI and the old spreadsheet formulae without playing with the actual product. Phone conversations are likely even less communicative.<p>2. Communication is a two-way street: releasing early allows you to get information from your users, but it also leaks information <i>to</i> your users, which may not present the image you want. Kickstarter has shown that with good enough marketing you can get paying customers with literally nothing. But you can also burn customers so they never want anything to do with your product ever again. There are numerous high-profile failures-to-deliver that have killed not only products, but the reputations of individuals and companies. But failure doesn&#x27;t have to be that catastrophic to lose customers permanently: all that has to happen is for someone to pay for your product, find it a bit lackluster, and decide to cancel their subscription. That user is worse than a non-user, because they are never going to be a user again, and might tell others about their experience. Short term success not only isn&#x27;t an indicator of long-term viability, it can <i>cause</i> long-term non-viability.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s cheaper to validate problem&#x2F;solution with phone calls and mocks&#x2F;designs, but you get what you pay for.<p>The best strategy probably lies somewhere in the middle: code a minimum viable product, but really make sure it&#x27;s the minimum, and really make sure you think it&#x27;s actually viable. A good compromise might be to release a discounted beta for select users--that lets you get feedback from paying customers up front, but also sets expectations so that users don&#x27;t get the wrong idea about your product before it&#x27;s mature enough for a real release. It also limits the exposure, so even if you burn a few beta users, you don&#x27;t burn your entire potential user base.",

A very significant margin of error is built into the ropes to account for this.<p>Rappel only exerts a force equivalent to your weight, plus a little extra because of bouncing that naturally occurs during descent. 1kN = 224lbs force, so if you weigh 200lbs you can expect to exert about 1kN of force on a static rope. About the weakest static rope people frequently rappel on is a 7mm line, and a typical one[1] is rated to 12.4kN. So abrasion, knots coming undone, losing control of the brake strand, etc. are much larger concerns than static rope breaking due to knots.<p>Static ropes are ideal for rappelling, but climbers will often use the same rope they lead climb on to rappel on, and for lead climbing applications your rope must be dynamic. The weakest ropes you would usually lead on would be something like 7.5mm half ropes. A typical example[2] doesn&#x27;t list a maximum breaking strength, because this statistic isn&#x27;t relevant for dynamic rope. The purpose of a dynamic rope is absorb force during a fall: if you take a lead fall on a static rope, it&#x27;s unlikely that the static rope will break, but hitting the end of a static rope is just as bad as hitting the ground with the same force. When you hit the end of a dynamic rope, it stretches to absorb this force, giving you a gentle fall. The maximum force on the rope listed is 9.9kN, which is from a UIAA-standard test fall: these falls are far more violent than anything you are likely to experience in actual usage. Ostensibly the rope can handle more force than that, but 9.9kN of force would probably kill you anyway. Luckily the rope stretch means it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;d get anywhere near that level of force: a typical lead fall is in the range of 2kN. So again with dynamic rope, margins of error are very high, and abrasion, knots coming undone, losing control of the brake strand, etc. are much larger concerns than static rope breaking due to knots.<p>This is all fine and good on paper and in a lab, but does it work in the real world? The answer is yes: real world accident statistics[3] indicate that the most common accidents on rappel are simply rappelling off the ends of your rope. I wasn&#x27;t able to find a single accident caused by rope breaking due to knots. Ropes <i>do</i> break, but this is typically attributed to abrasion over sharp surfaces, or long-term wear, and even these accidents are rare.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sterlingrope.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;climb&#x2F;cordage&#x2F;tag-lines&#x2F;7mm-tag"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sterlingrope.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;climb&#x2F;cordage&#x2F;tag-lines&#x2F;7mm-t...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mammut.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;p&#x2F;2010-02762-11190&#x2F;75-twilight-dry&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mammut.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;p&#x2F;2010-02762-11190&#x2F;75-twilight-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;publications.americanalpineclub.org&#x2F;about_accidents"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;publications.americanalpineclub.org&#x2F;about_accidents</a><p>EDIT: Just to be clear, although there is a correlation between thickness and strength, the thinnest ropes aren&#x27;t necessarily the weakest.

By the time that reaches steady state it&#x27;s a wash.<p>On top of that, VAT is great for people who are in debt (i.e. the poor), because no more income tax means they can pay down their existing debt with money they would have otherwise lost to income tax.<p>&gt; Amazon won&#x27;t &quot;pay the tax&quot; it will pass the tax along in the form of higher consumer prices.<p>The party who pays more of the tax is the party whose alternatives have gotten worse instead of better.

The primary problem is that shifting profits to other jurisdictions with lower taxes is easy to do and hard to prevent, and then there are no &quot;profits&quot; in the jurisdiction with the progressive tax, which turns the &quot;progressive&quot; tax into a massively regressive tax since the richest pay nothing.<p>The best way to fix it is to make everyone pay the same rate (so the rich can&#x27;t avoid it) and then make it progressive by giving everyone a fixed refund (UBI), which gives you the effective rate curve a progressive income tax is <i>supposed</i> to have except that international corporations can&#x27;t avoid it by declaring profits in Ireland.",

I have a farm and I want to automate it. I have been at it for five years now. To replace humans with machines, you need data. You need data sets to train the intelligence behind the machine. That data is expressed as numbers and in the language of mathematics.<p>Example: when I want to mow my cover crop field in spring, I simply do if I get a feel for it. I know it’s not going to rain..I know it’s before they have flowered, I know how the soil ‘feels’ before I can disc it. I just know. I pick up a handful of soil and then at the sky, in a split second I can make a decision.<p>But for a machine to make that decision, mathematically..it needs weather data, soil moisture data, leaf analysis, vision system data..put it all together to say ‘yes, I will prep the field today’. The language is mathematics.<p>In a way, I forecasted and predicted intuitively from previous years springs to determine when I can prep the field. I could be wrong. A farm machine AI however ..with math can make a decision based on narrow parameters but will almost never be wrong because it only has to be right within those narrow parameters.<p>Why can’t this be done with Astrology?<p>How can planets have an impact on humans..lets rephrase that..how can planets not have an impact on humans? The sun does. The moon does. That’s because we know heat and light are forms of energy. We acknowledge gravitational force and tidal waves and electro magnetic forces. Does this mean that there is nothing else? Perhaps there are forces we haven’t even met yet and don’t know how it works.<p>How can we ever figure it out if we dismiss it off hand because it feels ‘woo’. Nature isn’t ‘woo’. Nature doesn’t care how we label it.<p>We can only see if we want to look. We can’t look if we are afraid of being judged&#x2F;mocked&#x2F;downvoted&#x2F;flagged. Know what I mean?",

It reveals itself in dreams. And so it lingers...like a secretary taking notes and organizing them. Sometimes it comes back garbled as our dreams and not always decipherable.<p>Writing dream journals is a good habit.<p>I also want to write down not just dreams but also moods during eclipses and lunar cycles and match it to astrological transit charts.<p>What if there is a pattern..on an individual level and for the general collective and the for the larger society. If there are 300 or 500k such journals...would it be possible to figure out patterns and trends.<p>Can we do this by matching Facebook status updates or twitter or fit bit data etc? We already have so much data. How difficult would it be to match birth dates&#x2F;horoscopes to available data.<p>A social media app for tracking moods, life events and zodiac should be interesting.<p>I hesitated to use social media to describe it but did it anyways for lack of a better term. I don’t mean to suggest that this can be a ‘product’ for generating revenue. Somethings should be beyond exploitation for money.<p>What if we can have a window of insight into our own unconsciousness? And if there is no true free will, then we are still processing information that we are exposed to and making life decisions based on what we perceive subconsciously.<p>On the other hand, an acceptance of astrology and code of behaviour can steer a society into predictable patterns of behaviour leading to less conflict.<p>Think of it like a language.

It’s like pigeon Hansel and Gretel roulette.<p>They get exhausted if they can’t make it back home and many die.  [..] Pigeons can mate for life, and both the cock and the hen take turns sitting on the nest and feeding the hatchlings. Young homers are weaned and housed together at about six weeks old. After a few days of acclimation, a door in their pen is opened, and the birds begin to fly outside the loft but stick close to it. They’ll flock together, flying big circles, until the day comes that they stay aloft for an hour. That’s the signal, says Morse, that it’s time for road training. The birds are taken five miles away from the loft and released. “That first time, they make about thirty huge circles, figuring out where home is. But they do figure it out.”<p>Morse will do five days at five miles, then two days of loft flying, a kind of weekend of rest at home. The next week, it’s ten miles. When the birds start arriving home before him, it’s time to stretch out their mileage—twenty miles, then forty, sixty, and so on, until they successfully do one hundred miles three times before their first race. The longer flights build endurance, but it’s the early flights that reinforce the notion of home and the bird’s ability to get there. In a race, you want a pigeon to break fast and sure instead of wasting time circling or succumbing to the flock instinct and following other birds. “People get in a hurry for training distance, which is a mistake,” says Morse. “The five- and ten-mile trips are imperative. That gets them confident.” [..]",

In a overheated speculative real estate market like the Bay Area, the inflated values of homes means that even at 1.2 something %, it’s 10-15% of income(a million dollar home is about 12-14k in property tax which is a significant chunk of net income)<p>2. Sales tax: on all consumption.<p>3. Gas tax, utilities surcharge. Special taxes, parcel taxes etc<p>4. Hideous thing we have now that is toll charges. I guess it’s like a congestion charge. Which essentially means that if people have to come into Silicon Valley to work, they have to pay the toll trolls under the bridges, as it were..<p>It’s one thing for google employees to pay this, but imagine lower income and minimum wage labour folks shelling out money. This means that it’s effectively discrimination against jobs and businesses that can’t hire employees to pay them a liveable wage.<p>Often the companies are blamed, but is it really them or is it the tax hungry govt? It seems like a good distraction and make scapegoats out of workers in well paid sectors. It’s almost as if companies like google and the rest of FAANG have a complicit cozy arrangement with the govt. the more they hire, the more ka-Ching for the tax collectors.<p>In fact, my rule of thumb when someone is paraded as a villain..be it google or tech bros or seniors or prop 13..or anyone else, I always follow the money. More often than not, all roads lead to Sacramento. And there are a few scapegoats up front and they are mere distractions.<p>How can the govt bloat and red tape and inefficiencies be blamed on tech&#x2F;white colour working class who pay most of the states taxes? How is it possible that public schools don’t have swimming pools and adequate funds for programs when the millions of dollars in property taxes goes to the common state budget pot to be redistributed. Modesto schools are awesome even though they don’t nearly contribute as much as they receive and don’t have the density of Bay Area cities..and yet, high earning areas are blamed for creating inequalities. It’s just odd. If you just follow the money, it’s all pretty clear that all the usual suspects just happen to be convenient scapegoats.<p>5. Lack of good public transport means car, insurance, gas, registration, repairs etc. it adds up.<p>6. Then insurance which is actually part of your salary and because we don’t have universal health care, it’s technically wages every month.<p>Not to mention the latest head tax in Mountain View with most of it paid by google.<p>One of my neighbors ..to the contempt and disdain of other non techie folks&#x2F;retirees..proclaimed that after both the adults earning close to half a million, they barely live pay check to pay check with very little savings after buying a new home with their two kids in public school. Remarkable but that’s almost believable if they were leading a comfortable no scarcity life.<p>You can be on welfare at 45k in Oakland with 7 kids and 2 adults when you are poor and you have services and food stamps and welfare and subsidized housing. There is no where to go below. But when you are upper middle class and you have to pay for everything and what you work for is to maintain a standard of life, then 20k&#x2F;month isn’t enough for a family of 4.<p>Most tech employees are on the receiving end of scorn and contempt and envy in the Bay Area. Sometimes even within their own places of employment by transplants from east coast who have California COLA sticker shock or young people just out of school who don’t have families. There is a lot of derision here when one is ambitious and wants to be upward mobile. It’s really strange to me as someone witnessing all this Silicon Valley upheaval as an outsider.<p>This isn’t my circus as I am not working in SV but it’s really odd. I don’t know what to make of it or see the sense in it. I want to believe that everyone is justified in how they feel from their perspective, but it’s hard to understand how some feel like the most productive class in SV should be the most taxed and exploited.

It happens at school..you take kids who are hormonally challenged and have angst and frustration and you rub them the right way, you can create an army for any cause.<p>When you come from stable families and have personal mentors, the recruiting efforts in schools and colleges fail. Someone who is a friend living in Oakland mentioned the other day that black kids are going to be radicalized anyways there. It used to be that gangs were recruiting them in the past and now it’s schools recruiting them as they are the future vote bank when they become adults.<p>It was remarkable to me in that how similar this was to radicalized students in India. But that was usually after high school and during their public university years...because single parenthood was uncommon (during my time there) and parents were very involved with their kids till school and then they become raw bill board material especially when they leave home to go to study.<p>But in the USA, it starts earlier as public schools are parents and guardians by proxy. Single parenthood is more common and they have to work to make $$. That’s why I see school kids walking out to support their teachers when the teacher unions strike. I couldn’t believe it when I first witnessed it..they were kids and the teachers had no qualms about recruiting them for causes. I still can’t wrap my mind around it.<p>As I get older, I value my youth..especially the years before I turned 25. I have always read and tried to study all my life but the most optimal time was in the first 25 years. I was able to read and retain what I learnt. I was able to absorb what I read. I had financial freedom and health. I didn’t have financial responsibility and it came little by little. I was still young enough that I didn’t feel bad about asking for help from my family if I failed. I was forgiven easily for transgressions and people were patient with me because I had potential that goes hand in hand with youth. I had someone behind me who would go after those who would want to harm me. I enjoyed what I call the ‘elasticity of youth’ in that I could make a mistake, bounce back and fix it without being overly judged.<p>That is priceless. It mostly came because I had stable and supportive family. It is not ‘privilege’. I was the potential contained in the passed on genes of my family and they wanted to make sure I didn’t squander it. So they created the best environment for me. I had the added bonus of a large joint family which meant that the family was a miniature village of aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, nieces and nephews as one family unit.

In another galaxy, a long time ago there was some young guy who did freelance sysadmin and education for private people and small businesses, while assembling personal computers maindays in some omputer store. Let&#x27;s call that time 1995, where one early evening young Largo was asked by the very established owner of some electronic parts import-export business with whom he was on good terms if he liked what he does, and if he wanted to do it any longer?<p>Whereupon young Largo LOL&#x27;d almost hysterically and said: &#x27;What? <i>NO!&quot; This is so fucked up it isn&#x27;t funny anymore!&#x27;<p>He was very surprised and asked why, young Largo couldn&#x27;t
say exactly why and needed some minutes to collect his thougts and then began:<p>&#x27;This may come as a surprise to you, with me being an atheist, but what we have now reminds me of the story
in the old testament of the bible about the building of
the Tower of Babylon.&#x27;<p>That indeed raised some eyebrows!<p>Young Largo rambled on about the siloing of data in different non-interoperable applications for reasons of customer tie in, which is against the interests of said
customer. About the bloat in software which requires ever more potent hardware in regular intervals with every new software version, while the old ones would be perfectly servicable if they only could read the data from the newer versions, which of course is a No-Go because it is against the interest of the software producers.<p>He rambled on about lack of stability and unintuiveness of
UX while compairing that with kitchen- and general household appliances, which would be considered useless and broken if they required the effort PC&#x27;s did then.<p>He fantasized on about something which combined the ease of use of Hypercard and Visual Basic in some hypothetic platform with the versatility and networkability of some Unix, extendable with modules available in countless variations like in DOS&#x2F;WIN in a way every other &#x27;module&#x27; would benefit from, because of extended capabilities and &#x27;teaching&#x27; them new data formats, creating a bespoke environment exactly fitting your needs, while being able to run on ridiculously cheap and small hardware, nonetheless capable of reading everything you could reasonably throw at them.<p>Young Largo rambled on about the impossibility of this happening in our current society and economy with patents, intellectual property, and so on, that this was easy to see and extrapolate into not getting any better EVER!<p>Because even then bloat was a thing.<p>What young Largo didn&#x27;t really knew at the time were Plan9, OS-9, QNX and TRON but he had dabbled in 386&#x2F;FreeBSD, early Linuxes, knew some FORTHs and some Assemblers and paid a shitload of money for his ISDN to get onto the internet with his hot rod Pentium.<p>Young Largo concluded then that this all was nothing else but the biggest bullshit job creation program since the
building of the egyptian pyramids, and at the end of the day 
almost as useless as them for society, with a few exceptions
of research and simulation, CAD&#x2F;CAM and such, but not applicable to the general public.<p>When asked &#x27;But what for!?&#x27; he answered: &#x27;How should i know?
TO THE STARS!&#x27;<p>There could be a prequel to this, where an even younger Largo said in school that he wanted every computer being able to speak with each other, one big universal library,
when being asked in class what the biggest thing he wished for would be.&#x27;<p>That was pre- or proto-internet<p>Anyways, in a purely technical way all of this is possible,
and even has been realized in parts, or as complete proof of concept, </i>except the ability of handling proprietary data formats by already entrenched market players behind their moats.*<p>So one part of the army of bullshit jobbers is pecking like vultures at the long rotten carcasses which were thrown out of some research labs eons ago for antimonopolistic reasons, producing nothing but bloated zombies in different paint schemes. Another part specializes in exploiting the bullshit jobbers with proprietary software and services which don&#x27;t really run according to their needs, but clogging their toilets, while the part who feels like it is the airforce tries to simulate being intelligent while unable to reliably reproduce or even explain their cheap stunts, the part being the navy looming beneath the waves and snorting..err snorkeling every and any shit, while the real spaceforce which does solid engineering could have been up in the sky in O&#x27;-Neil cylinders since decades, if the rest of the retarded shitheads wouldn&#x27;t have dragged them down so much.<p>Instead of the universal library with nice haptics i got

The issue here is at a different level.<p>Let&#x27;s consider an AI that weighs in on hiring decisions. Let&#x27;s consider what it might make of maternity.<p>Decades ago, it wasn&#x27;t unusual for a prospective employer to ask a female applicant whether she was planning on getting pregnant. Society decided that wasn&#x27;t acceptable, and made the practice unlawful (as well as forcing employers to offer paid maternity leave), despite that, from a profit-seeking perspective, that is valuable information for the prospective employer to have.<p>Let&#x27;s suppose an AI has been trained on a dataset of previous hiring decisions, and some measure of how much value those employees went on to deliver. Let&#x27;s suppose it&#x27;s also told the age and sex of the applicants. It might notice that female applicants within a certain age range, have a tendency to have a long period of zero productivity, some time after being hired. Having noticed this correlation, it would then discriminate against applicants matching that profile.<p><i>But wait!</i>, I hear you think, <i>Why did we provide it data on sex and age? Remove those data-points and the problem goes away.</i> Not so. There could be non-obvious correlations acting as proxies for that information. The system might detect these correlations.<p>In a parole-board context, suspects&#x27; names and addresses could be proxies for ethnicity, which could correlate with recidivism rates. The &#x27;correct&#x27; behaviour for a correlation-seeking AI is to detect those correlations, and then start to systematically discriminate against individuals of certain ethnicities, even when their crime and personal conduct is identical to another individual of a different ethnicity.<p>Back to our maternity leave example, then. It&#x27;s an interesting exercise to come up with possible correlations. The ones that occur to me:<p>* Given names (if provided to the AI) generally tell you a person&#x27;s sex<p>* Given names also fall in and out of fashion over the decades, so there&#x27;s a correlation with age<p>* The topics a person chose to study at university, can correlate with the person&#x27;s sex, as well as their age, as some fields didn&#x27;t exist 40 years ago<p>* The culture a person is from, may impact the statistically expected number of children for them to have, and at what age. Various things could act as proxies for this.",

It&#x27;s probably its greatest downside. Making it <i>even more</i> complex, should only be done with very good reason.<p>If you doubt this, consider the continued popularity of C, a thoroughly anaemic language by today&#x27;s standards, with no clear advantages over C++ except for its simplicity, minimalism, and that the language changes <i>very</i> slowly. Well, that and its existing adoption levels. It&#x27;s not quite the case that every feature C has is also in C++, but it&#x27;s very close, and I can only name one exception: variable-length arrays (an unpopular addition to C) are not officially supported in C++.<p>C++&#x27;s complexity means that:<p>* It&#x27;s very difficult to learn. It&#x27;s extremely difficult to learn well. It&#x27;s just about impossible to learn in its entirety. This isn&#x27;t an exaggeration. (Andrei Alexandrescu might be the closest we have to someone who knows <i>all</i> of C++. He&#x27;s a world famous C++ expert. Mortals don&#x27;t stand a chance.)<p>* Different C++ programmers know (and write in) different subsets of the language. Good C programmers know essentially all of C. (I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m weak on C&#x27;s bitfields, and I couldn&#x27;t tell you every subtlety of its memory model, but when it comes to C++, there may be areas of the language I&#x27;ve never even heard of.)<p>* C++ style guides (such as Google&#x27;s one, or LLVM&#x27;s one) are long and complex documents, by necessity<p>* We will never have a fully complete C++ compiler that truly matches the language spec. This undermines the spec; the language you&#x27;re <i>really</i> using depends on your C++ compiler. To put that another way: portability is harmed because different C++ compilers cannot be relied upon to support the same language features.<p>* C++ compilers are more prone to arcane bugs, than C compilers<p>* Different C++ compilers have different arcane bugs, harming portability<p>* It&#x27;s far easier to develop tools for C than for C++ (compilers, IDEs, etc)<p>* There are more C compilers out there than C++ compilers, especially for targets like PIC, or for very obscure platforms, or for particular needs such as safety-critical work. There&#x27;s even a formally verified C compiler (&#x27;CompCert&#x27;) with near-complete support for C99&#x27;s features. I doubt there will ever be a formally verified C++ compiler.<p>* C is easier to mechanically reason about; there are more static-analysis tools for C than for C++<p>* If C++ were simpler it might have given rise to stable ABIs, the way C has. Instead, even different versions of the same C++ compiler might not be interoperable.<p>* It&#x27;s less predictable regarding performance. Template metaprogramming can bloat your binaries for seemingly no reason. In C however, all features of the language map naturally to assembly; the programmer can generally predict roughly what assembly will be generated. This matters to those working with operating systems, graphics, high-performance programming, or where side-channel attacks are a security concern.<p>C++ is also faster-moving than C, meaning:<p>* It takes more work to maintain your skills for reading other people&#x27;s code<p>* Code can age. Old code looks different from new code, unless it&#x27;s actively maintained, which means work and risks new bugs. If the language rarely changes, this problem goes away.<p>* If you&#x27;re developing a compiler, you&#x27;d rather a stable language like C, so that you don&#x27;t have to make a career out of keeping up with the latest additions to the language. Keeping up with the additions to C++ is more than any one compiler-engineer could hope to do.<p>There are very few &#x27;conservative&#x27; languages like C (there are also Scheme and Forth), but it can be a language&#x27;s greatest strength. Zig is hoping to be another such language, but we&#x27;ll have to see if it succeeds.<p>With all of that said, I tend to favour C++ over C, and I <i>really</i> like pattern-matching. It&#x27;s something that cannot really be &#x27;faked&#x27; with templates or macros. (Another personal favourite feature of mine, named arguments, is similar in that regard.) I think it&#x27;s rather silly that the major OOP languages have until recently completely ignored this brilliant language feature from the functional programming world, as if it adds nothing over switch&#x2F;case. Even D, an extremely feature-rich language, still lacks pattern matching.",

What is your condition for an optimal test?<p>&gt;From this point of view, writing testable code is a statement about controlling the complexity of test plans. Things like instead of having a function take a few representations, make it only take a canonical representation and provide adapter functions. For example, if you have a function f(t0, tn) that takes two timestamps, you could have t0 and tn be seconds since epoch, offsets relative to now, or some kind of text date format. If f accepts all three, then you have a test plan of size 9*N. If it accepts just seconds since the epoch, you have N + 2 (for the adapter functions). This kind of calculation provides concrete statements about making code more testable.<p>Your statements are inconsistent here can you clarify with a more detailed example? You talk about a function that takes two variables then you suddenly say f takes all three. What is your definition of the size of a test plan? What is N? Is it the cardinality of the parameters?

In all intermediary state in between interfaces to the framework you are allowed to have mutating state. So you actually have freedom to do any style in JS.

Right? This is totally legal and not even a niche use case so you can do whatever the hell you want in react. It&#x27;s the interface to the framework that is supposedly FRP.

When we &quot;design&quot; something we are pulling a solution out of our imagination with no way to verify that it is the most &quot;optimal&quot; solution.

One definition of &quot;optimal&quot; in mathematics (a small universe similar to programming) is the shortest distance. For this we have a calculation: a line. Another definition of &quot;optimal&quot; in the reality we occupy as humans (a large universe much bigger than math or the simulation in our computer systems) is the shortest time it takes for a human to move from A to B. The solution to this is &quot;designed&quot; we have several options to choose from but to fulfill the requirement of shortest time... we currently tend to choose a plane as it is the fastest vehicle available.

There is much research on this topic, I&#x27;d look into Prolog, category theory, dependent types, formal methods and that kind of thing to learn more.
