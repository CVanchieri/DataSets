1584576,Mz,Mz,1281224545,2010-08-07 23:42:25 UTC,"<i>We need a word different than ""homeless"", really.</i><p><i>Today we've pretty much solved the basic home problem in the civilized world.</i><p>----------------<p>Some data on American housing and such, that may not be 100% accurate but should paint a general picture:<p>Around 60 years ago, the average new home was about 1200 sq ft and housed a family of 5 (2 parents, 3 kids).  Today, it is over 2000 sq ft and houses a family of 3 (2 parents, 1 kid). This difference and other factors has helped create a widening gap between the haves and have-nots:  Those who can afford a new home live like kings.  Those who can't may be perpetually one paycheck away from homelessness.  Most of the financing instruments we have are aimed at single family suburban homes designed to meet the needs of a 1950's-style nuclear family.  Meanwhile, our demographics have changed and very few people fit that bill.  The housing industry has been terribly slow to adapt to the changing needs of our changing demographics.<p>Also, historically, it was more common to live with extended family.  This was more manageable back when more than half the American population lived and worked on a farm.  You could always put someone to work on the farm to help cover the cost of feeding and housing them.  But a more city-centric lifestyle means that if you have no job, you typically aren't viewed as a contributing member of the household and it is much harder for people to extend generosity in that regard unless they are truly wealthy.  We also had more SRO housing and boarding houses -- just the sort of supportive environment that the Murray's of the world seem to need.  This was part and parcel of the culture and was not considered some kind of ""special service"" for problem individuals who couldn't adapt.  It was also cheaper than a stand-alone apartment.  Apartments designed for a nuclear family or houses designed for a nuclear family make up the majority of housing stock in the US and it is financially out of reach for many single individuals.  College students often get multiple roommates to make it work but it really isn't designed to work for them.  The Murray's of the world lack the ability to force the current housing situation to serve them adequately and mostly don't have other options which did exist not that many decades ago.<p>I have a lot more thoughts and information on the subject but I don't care to beat it to death.  The current housing situation really is a factor in why homelessness has been on the rise in recent years.  Yes, it is one of many.  But I don't think it can be lightly dismissed.",1584536,,,0
4889323,Mz,Mz,1354915543,2012-12-07 21:25:43 UTC,"Sorry. There is no intent to be evasive.<p>The thing I am reacting negatively to is not the current laws concerning smoking but specifically the public announcement that they will only issues warnings. That is practically an invitation to people who want to be defiant assholes to do whatever they want.<p>Laws are merely one tool for trying to keep the peace. And the reality is that if you actually have to enforce the law (overly much), you have already kind of failed. I struggle with how to say this clearly, because any sweeping statement is going to be wrong and invite attack and a lot of people are very uncomfortable with how things actually work. But, basically, you announce what is illegal knowing some people will politely do as they are told and then you put in place just enough consequences to act as a deterent to folks who are less inclined to simply do as they are told. Of course, some people will break the law for various reasons. Either they didn't know or it is a poorly designed law that is nearly impossible to obey or...whatever. However if things are done right, there will only be a moderate need for active enforcement. But an announcement like this amounts to a public invitation to do as you please. Some people will do it just because of this invitation, just like some seventeen year olds with college ID's will drink because some places will take a college ID at the door. It is a loophole and some people will take childish glee in that space where it kind of is forbidden but really is not.<p>That is the piece I hope California handles better. I also hope that the fact that there is medical marijuana here already will help prevent the ""must get drunk on my 21st birthday"" style of reaction that you so often see when things finally get legalized. I believe that drugs and alcohol tend to attract people who somehow benefit physically. In California, if you really need marijuana and can prove it, it is already legal. Folks who are merely recreational users are going to be less rabid about wanting to fight for and exercise their right to toke. I think it is the people who strongly benefit (medically in some way) who are the most vehement. And those people are mostly already okay to smoke it here.

It looks to me like the <i>immense amount of money involved in the fossil fuel industries</i> is basically a survival/self-preservation issue.  And so is trying to clean up the environment so the species as a whole can survive.  It generally does not help to disregard the short-term survival needs of the people you are arguing with and leap straight to an assumption of ""malice"", which assumes they actively want to hurt people.  Willingness to disregard the welfare of others (or downplay long-term negative consequences out of fear of the short-term consequences) because one has a compelling survival issue is not the same thing as malice.  I also believe firmly that in many cases they really just don't see a problem, at least not one compelling enough to embrace/justify the kind of ""radical"" positions that the opposition takes.<p>I live without a car.  In online forums where I talk about my choice to live without a car, it sometimes gets very freaked out reactions from people.  People who are in no position to give up their car find my views and my choices very personally threatening.

It's just that community building is a little like raising kids:  ""Do as I say, not as I do"" is one of the most ineffective (and even counterproductive) ways to try to pursue the goal.  So what you see a lot of in public forums is that moderators and owners get frustrated with bad behavior and then publicly get all over someone's case for it in an effort to ""improve"" the situation. This typically amounts to putting out the fire with gasoline.<p>Anyway, the point is that giving people examples is the single most effective means to foster community.  Way more effective, efficient, and fast than trying to tell people what to do.

The collapse is continuing because even after an infinite time, as measured by a distant observer, the collapse is still not complete. Rather, the departure from a static configuration of Schwarzschild radius r=2m as seen by a distant observer diminishes exponentially in time, with a characteristic time of the order of 2m, or about 10 microseconds for an object of one solar mass. The box explains the purely geometrical system of units employed in general relativity. In this sense, the system is a “frozen star.”<p>In another sense, the system is not frozen at all. On the
contrary, the dimensions shrink to indefinitely small values in a finite and very short proper time for an observer moving with the collapsing matter (see figure 3). Moreover, a spherical system appears black from outside; no light can escape. Light shot at it falls in. A particle shot at it falls in.<p>A “meter stick” would be let down in vain to measure the dimensions of the object. The stick is pulled to pieces by tidal forces, and the broken-off pieces fall in without a trace. In these senses, the system is a black hole&quot;<p>So this seems to be an international term, and indeed both the Russian wikipedia <a href=""http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A7%D1%91%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%B4%D1%8B%D1%80%D0%B0"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ru.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;%D0%A7%D1%91%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%...</a> and English-language one mention it.<p>Couple of other hits in search do mention that the term was used in 1960s - which probably explains the reason why it does sound a bit strange :-)<p>Anyway, it was fun to do this little investigation, thanks!",7895928,,,0

It is clearly important, for example, that billing information and commercial transaction records be handled with this type of strong consistency.""<p>Notice it says ""... committed transactions are visible to all future transactions (consistent), ...""<p>This is not correct because the data can be overwritten by a subsequent transaction.<p>In this version of the same paper

By virtue of the universe expanding, the distance between points grows faster than the speed of light as long as those points are sufficiently far apart. This becomes more interesting when you realize that new space in between these points is being created. Sure, the galaxies traveling on this expanding medium are not actually speeding apart powered by classical movement, but they are nevertheless changing position relative to one another in an interesting way.<p>In fact, what we&#x27;re interested in when we talk about FTL is not classical movement at all - what we want is to change positions instead. There are places in nature where we know this is happening right now, for example we do know space can &quot;flow&quot; faster than the speed of light on the far side of event horizons.<p>So if we abandon the idea that we need to accelerate towards a destination, FTL becomes a broader idea of manipulating spacetime in order to be somewhere in less time than if we had actually flown there at the speed of light. There exist proposals for propulsion systems that go in this direction, for example the &quot;warp drive&quot; ideas that cheat by simply shortening the amount of space a vessel has to travel through. Some of these concepts seem to work in theory, for some definition of <i>work</i>.<p>The trouble with all these ideas is they need impractical amounts of energy. Which is wasteful, since we only need to bend spacetime for a short while and then return it to its original state behind us, something that works analogous to a catalyst would be much better.<p>At the most fundamental level though, what we are missing is a way of hacking spacetime. Huge masses and energies are how nature bends it, but ideally we would need some other way of manipulating the fabric of existence directly. This is the reason why drive systems in science fiction all have some kind of yet-unknown mystery substance critical to their function. Given how little we actually know about the basic fabric of the universe, ways of doing these manipulations may well exist. They might not. We most likely won&#x27;t find out for centuries, if ever.<p>Until then, we must answer the question so that yes, FTL is most likely possible in theory, but it&#x27;s not even remotely within our grasp right now. It might never work in practice.<p>Another observation worth considering: cosmic travel times seem utterly problematic right now because we individually live for extremely short periods of time. Spending a few thousand years in transit is much less worrisome if you&#x27;re, say, an autonomous machine carrying an AI through the galaxy.",8615224,,,0

For example, the argument was raised that because you <i>obviously</i> can&#x27;t have several instances of your consciousness at the same time, this can never work. There was the argument that any would-be left-over physical body somehow remains the home of the mind, and there would <i>obviously</i> be an impostor around pretending to be me but ultimately not <i>being</i> me. At two points, it was suggested that I (specifically, I, Udo) be killed to prove that I care about my existence and the existence of forks based on me, which I do and which does not really have any meaningful connection to the question of the feasibility of copying. I also said that the &quot;problem&quot; of the left-over body most likely won&#x27;t arise due to technical limitations of the process. Still, that didn&#x27;t count and people still think that uploading minds is like building pyramids. Finally, the argument was made that both instances are by necessity different, if only because they occupy a different positions in space, to which I tried to explain that, yes, they&#x27;re different and they&#x27;ll continue to become more different over time, and yet that doesn&#x27;t have any real bearing on the proposed possibility or impossibility of the whole concept.<p>This is where I apologize and withdraw from the discussion.

The cost of encrypt&#x2F;decrypt would be modular exponentiation which isn&#x27;t that bad.  My point is though that as long as there is some number of bits where RSA is secure and it&#x27;s use is practical then RSA isn&#x27;t dead.  A lot of the discussion seems to imply RSA will be dead soon as a result of recent work.  Maybe it will or maybe it won&#x27;t but it seems the claims are a bit overblown.  I agree with the idea that we need to design to the possibility of RSA falling (or ECC falling) within reason but RSA could have fallen 5 years ago and it could fall tomorrow (and so can ECC).,6193041,,,0

I think the difference in what happens in Scrum is that the team gets further isolated from an organization through the ScrumMaster and Product Owner and therefore has less ability to influence and more process imposed (the various invariable rituals of Scrum and more).  The teams are now viewed as units of production, stick story in, get implementation out.

In addition, intelligence is often seen as a fixed thing.  Any reasonable and practical definition of intelligence is in complete contradiction to this idea.<p>Study after study shows that an apparent talent (or intelligence) in one moment does not correlate with future potential talent, intelligence, or general potential for achievement in anything.<p>So to add to your point -- who knows when Feynman took the test and got a 122, and who knows which test he even took -- to me this point decreases any commonly understood value of the IQ test to an even greater extent.<p>Quote from Alfred Binet (creator of the first IQ test) himself:
“I have not sought in the above lines to sketch a method of measuring, in the physical sense of the word, but only a method of classification of individuals. The procedures which I have indicated will, if perfected, come to classify a person before or after such another person or such another series of persons; but I do not believe that one may measure one of the intellectual aptitudes in the sense that one measures length or a capacity.  Thus, when a person studied can retain seven figures after a single audition, one can class him, from the point of his memory for figures, after the individual who retains eight figures under the same conditions, and before those who retain six.  It is a classification, not a measurement…we do not measure, we classify.”",3906834,,,0

He said ""I don't know how near the singularity is, but I haven't heard any convincing argument why it won't happen"". That seems like a more sensible position than the one offered by Allen in this piece. There is indeed a lot of uncertainty in the rate of progress. But Allen contorts that fact to say that the singularity <i>isn't</i> near. He offers three basic critiques:<p>First, he points out that Kurzweil is extrapolating, and extrapolations can be wrong. This seems obvious. And it doesn't do much towards Paul's ""isn't"".<p>Second, he says that software and hardware will have to keep improving, and that might not happen. Again, this seems intellectually equivalent to saying ""you might be wrong"". No evidence is provided that progress will slow.<p>Third, he says that the singularity will require either a bottom-up biologically inspired model, or a non-biologically inspired ""AI"" system.<p>The complexity of the former will take a long time to overcome. Since Allen concedes that sufficient computational power is already here, he seems to be arguing that it will take over a hundred years for us to have a detailed model of the human brain. Looking at the progress of science, this seems terribly conservative, yet little justification is offered. Allen's posited ""complexity brake"" seems positioned tendentiously — why are we going to start hitting it now, instead of fifty years ago?<p>As for the AI route, he writes: ""But when we step back, we can see that overall AI-based capabilities haven’t been exponentially increasing either, at least when measured against the creation of a fully general human intelligence."" What does it even mean to be exponential relative to a binary variable? He is right to say that current methods are limited, and don't achieve generalized intelligence, but offers no reason why that won't happen. His argument seems equivalent to simply saying it hasn't happened yet.<p>This piece offers little intellectual contribution, and the only reason we're reading it piece is because of the author. It reads like he started from the conclusion he wanted, and threw some paragraphs in that direction. His argument, essentially, is that he's betting <i>against</i> continued progress in science, software, and hardware. That just seems crazy.",4925204,,,0

They literally need to use other peoples money.  You could ask why AirBnB doesn't purchase apartments in New York and San Francisco.<p>A distributed model where other people contribute their money, and the business makes money as an agency is well established in other fields.  I know of many holiday properties where each individual apartment is privately owned, but the building is managed by a single entity.  The owners wear the depreciation costs and interest charges (if using borrowed money) but get to keep the majority of the revenue from rentals, and any capital appreciation from the property, or wear any losses from a drop in value.<p>In the same way, a startup can allow others to contribute the capital value, wear any depreciation, financing and insurance, and just take an agency fee.   This is really not much different to other rental car companies who presumably lease all of the rental vehicles either off some central owner of the vehicles, or directly from the manufacturer.  Or, perhaps they just have a large, revolving credit line which they use to purchase the vehicles.

You don't see it because you're not in their shoes, that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It's fine and all that people do disagree, that's just the context for my post.<p>If you want someone to see things your way, build a bridge over the gap in their misunderstanding.  DHH's blog post its just preaching to the converted.  That's why I asked the context and audience.  Saying ""Rails is omakase"" is a lot like saying ""git stores a directed acyclic graph of revisions"" or ""A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors"".  Almost nobody gets it unless they already get it, and the behavior he seemed to be complaining about was critcism from the unwashed masses.  It just doesn't fit. I asked who gives a fuck because what small sliver of his audience is going to both understand what he is trying to express AND take anything new away from the post?<p>My initial read was wrong, because (to stretch his abused metaphor) he is actually talking about the fact his chefs and regular customers really seem to think 2 tsp of spice in the soup would be better than the 1 tsp he is insistent on using. Which makes his post make even less sense.  He could have have ditched the flowery prose, meandering critcisms of criticism and just said ""This is important to me, I'm pulling rank.""",4974412,,,0
